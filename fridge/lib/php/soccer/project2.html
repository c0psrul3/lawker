CS313 PROJECT2
SOCCER-PLAYING TEAM

You are again to work in MIXED-background pairs.  This project should be
ready for progress-demonstration as noted below, and for final submission
in three weeks.

You are to write a program to be a greenplayer or a redplayer (your
choice, A/A- if you can do either) in the soc2.cgi simulator (or its later
version/s).  If you want, you can create a subdirectory in 04-02 for
your own development.  This is linked into the public_html space, so
you can see your work and run the cgi simulator from the web.
The address will be http://k9.cs.wustl.edu/~cs313/04-02/yourname/soc2.cgi.
You will probably want to click on init, then on params, the specify
your program.  If you look at the header of soc2.cgi, it says that
you need a tmp subdirectory which is a+rwx, and dirs and pos should be
a+rw.  Any player you write should be a+rx, as should be any cgi.  init
should be a+r.

You might look at the directory on k9.cs.wustl.edu, cs313/soccer,
and try ./soc4.awk for inspiration.  Our simulator is new this semester
and has some advantages and some disadvantages compared to the older
simulator.

Your program will be called repeatedly during a soccer game
(which for now does not end!).  It will be given the input
"red" or "green" on /dev/stdin.  It will generate output such as

a red     
b red -18 20   
c red -14 20   
d red 0 0   
e red 0 0   
f red -20 -20   
g red -20 -20   

which specifies a direction (row column) vector for each player.
You should only output controls for players of your team color.  
We will ignore any other output, but the effect will be to slow down
the simulator, hence, to ruin the animation.

You may read the dirs and pos files, but should not alter them.
The pos file looks like this (for each player or the ball, row, column,
and energy level, 0-100, 100 is full; you might also see that the ball,
"0", is staticn, if it has not been given a velocity in n moves, and 
the word "aloft" if the ball is in the air):

0 black 141 485 100  static1
A green 150 595 100  
B green 60 363 74  
C green 132 448 100  
D green 124 562 93  
E green 212 559 95  
F green 194 535 86  
G green 139 600 19  
a red 150 5 100  
b red 141 95 38  
c red 137 466 47  
d red 100 30 100  
e red 200 30 100  
f red 164 500 69  
g red 164 507 70  

This is what the dirs file looks like:
 
0 black 0 0   
A green     
B green 0 0   
C green 2 20   
D green 20 -20   
E green -20 -20   
F green -20 -20   
G green -16 -20   
a red     
b red -18 20   
c red -14 20   
d red 0 0   
e red 0 0   
f red -20 -20   
g red -20 -20   

It is easy to "invert" the board for reversing red/green play just by
subtracting the column value from 600.  The width of the field is 600,
the height is 300.  The goals are 16 pixels high, centered on the
midline.  There is no off-sides, and the goalie area is under changing
specifications at the moment.

Your players may move at most 20 pixels in each direction.  This will soon
change to a 20-30 pixel maximum vector length.  They tire in proportion to
how far they move.  The simulator keeps players at the boundaries if they
try to move beyond the playing area.  Energy and movement profiles will
be added to cause players to have different inherent properties.

A player may kick the ball by adding "kick" in the fifth field, and a
row and column vector in the sixth and seventh fields.  The player may
also specify "kick.aloft".  There is no requirement that the player
move and kick in the same direction.  Kicking is limited to 2.5x the
movement limit.  Players tire in proportion to the kicking.  Kicking is  
effective if the ball is found near a kicking player within approx 6
pixels (subject to some variation). 

Here is an example of a directive for player f to kick:

f red -2 2 kick.aloft 424.858 302

Players are processed in decreasing order of remaining energy level.

Players control areas around them so that even their teammates may not
enter where they have moved or where they are positioned in a turn.
The specification of this is also subject to some change.  Currently,
a dense radius of about 3 pixels is controlled by a player and a 
sparse radius of about 8 pixels.

A goal is scored when the ball ends its turn's movement in one of the goals.
Currently, goals cannot be scored on shots that pass through the goal.
Goals are less probable when the ball is aloft.  After a goal, the field
resets to the initial position.

Goalies do not have any special properties (yet), e.g., regarding  the
ability to kick the ball away.  We will probably be adding the property 
that only they can move into the goal area, and that they can kick
with a higher kick limit.

A bounce of balls kicked on the ground into another player or into the goal
will be added.

At the moment, I want to see you write your player (you may modify
dummy1 or dummy2 if you choose) so that you can exhibit some control
over your players.

The goal in the second and third weeks will be to exhibit interesting
and effective behavior.

Your programs should be "turned in" by placing a subdirectory on
k9.cs.wustl.edu in the cs313 account "04-02" directory, with your last
names in lower case.  Your program should be called "team-yourname", and
should be able to read and write the files "dirs" and "pos" in their
PARENT directory, or should be able to read "payoffs" and "offers" from
symbolic links in your subdirectory, which link to the parent directory.

Don't forget that you need an html file describing your work when you do
the final submission or we cannot assign you a grade.
