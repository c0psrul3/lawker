This is a 150 line CMS, written in PHP that serves files from an on-line repository.

The only essential files are index.php, lastRSS.php, and config.php.

If you copy these three files to a web-accessible directory, you will get the whole site.

If you want to configure the site, you need to 
	
    svn export http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/fridge/etc/

and play with the file etc/config.xml.

Good luck!
