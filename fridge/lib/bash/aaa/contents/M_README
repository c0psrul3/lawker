I was able to get the "aaa" program to run on ULTRIX (BSD4.2), with a
few minor problems.  My system does not have the "getopt" program, so I
had to comment out line 7 of the aaa script (this makes it impossible
to enter dash options, if you really need those options and don't have
getopt(1), you can change the script to parse for them yourself.)  I
also found that "awk" lived on a different directory on our system
"/usr/local", so I had to change line 1 of aaa to include that in the
PATH.
