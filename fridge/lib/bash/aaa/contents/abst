Simple assemblers can be written using the shell, \fIawk\fR, and \fIsed\fR,
with no C code whatsoever.
They accept a fairly conventional input
language, and produce Intel hex output.
(True binary output would require a C program for the final conversion
to binary.)
They run quite slowly, their input language is restrictive and contrived,
and error checking is almost totally absent,
but they are quick and easy to write and change.
