<h2>Description</h2>
   <p>    Aaslg and aaslr implement the Amazing Awk Syntax Language,  AASL  (pro-
       nounced	``hassle'').   Aaslg  (pronounced  ``hassling'') takes an AASL
       specification from the concatenation of the file(s)  (default  standard
       input)  and  emits  the	corresponding  AASL  table on standard output.
       Aaslr parses the contents  of  the  file(s)  (default  standard	input)
       according  to the AASL table in file table, emitting the table's output
       on standard output.
<p>
       Both take a -x option to turn on verbose and cryptic debugging  output.
       Both  look  in  a  library directory for pieces of the AASL system; the
       AASLDIR environment variable, if present, overrides the default	notion
       of the location of this directory.
<p>
       Aaslr expects input to consist of input tokens, one per line.  For sim-
       ple tokens, the line is just the text of  the  token.   For  metatokens
       like  ``identifier'',  the line is the metatoken's name, a tab, and the
       text of the token.  [xxx discuss `#' lines]
<p>
       Aaslr output, in the absence of syntax errors, consists	of  the  input
       tokens  plus action tokens, which are lines consisting of `#!' followed
       immediately by an identifier.  If the syntax  of  the  input  does  not
       match  that  specified  in  the AASL table, aaslr emits complaint(s) on
       standard error and attempts to repair the input into a legal form;  see
       ``ERROR REPAIR'' below.	Unless errors have cascaded to the point where
       aaslr gives up (in which case it emits the action token ``#!aargh''  to
       inform  later  passes  of  this), the output will always conform to the
       AASL syntax given in the table.
<p>
       Normally, a complete program using AASL consists of three  passes,  the
       middle  one  being an invocation of aaslr.  The first pass is a lexical
       analyzer, which breaks free-form input down into input tokens  in  some
       suitable  way.	The third pass is a semantics interpreter, which typi-
       cally responds to input tokens by momentarily remembering them  and  to
       action  tokens  by  executing  some  action, often using the remembered
       value of the previous input token.  Aaslg is in fact implemented  using
       AASL,  following  this  structure;  it implements the -x option by just
       passing it to aaslr.
<h2>
AASL Specifications</h2>
<p>
       An AASL specification consists of class definitions, text  definitions,
       and  rules, in arbitrary order (except that class definitions must pre-
       cede use of the classes they define).  A `#' (not enclosed in a string)
       begins  a  comment;  characters	from  it  to  the  end of the line are
       ignored.  An identifier follows the  same  rules  as  a	C  identifier,
       except  that  in most contexts it can be at most 16 characters long.  A
       string is enclosed in double quotes ("") and generally follows  C  syn-
       tax.   Most  strings  denote  input  tokens,  and references to ``input
       token'' as part of AASL specification syntax should be read as ``string
       denoting input token''.
<p> 
       A  class  definition  is  an identifier enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;>)
       followed by one or more input tokens followed by a semicolon  (;).   It
       gives  a name to a set of input tokens.	Classes whose names start with
       capital letters are user abbreviations; see below.  Classes whose names
       start  with  lowercase  letters	are special classes, used for internal
       purposes.  The current special classes are:
<p>
<dl>
    <dt>   trivial
	    <dd>   tokens which the parser can discard at will, in the expectation
	       that  they  might be inserted erroneously; see ``ERROR REPAIR''
	       for details.

    <dt>   lineterm
	    <dd>   tokens which terminate a logical line for  purposes  of	resyn-
	       chronization in error repair; see ``ERROR REPAIR'' for details.

      <dt> endmarker
	      <dd> xxx
</dl>
<P>
       For example, the class definitions used for AASL itself are:
<pre>
&lt;trivial> "," ";"   ;
&lt;lineterm> ";" ;
&lt;endmarker> "EOF"   ;
</pre>
<p>

       When AASL error repair is invoked, the parser sometimes needs to gener-
       ate  input  tokens.   In  the case of a metatoken, the parser knows the
       token's name but needs to generate a text for it as well.  A text defi-
       nition consists of an input token, an arrow (->), and a string specify-
       ing what text should be generated for that  token.   For  example,  the
       text definitions used for AASL itself are:
<pre>
"id" -> "___"
"string" -> "\"___\""
</pre>
<p>
       The  rules  of a specification define the syntax that the parser should
       accept.	The order of rules is not significant, except that  the  first
       rule is considered to be the top level of the specification.  The spec-
       ification is executed by calling the first rule; when execution of that
       rule  terminates,  execution  of  the specification terminates.	If the
       user wishes this to occur only at end of input, he should  arrange  for
       the  lexical  analyzer  to  produce  an endmarker token (conventionally
       ``EOF'') at the end of the input, and should write the  first  rule  to
       require that token at the end.
<p>
       Note  that  an  input token may be recognized considerably before it is
       accepted, but the parser emits it to the output only on acceptance.
<p>
       A rule consists of an identifier naming it, a colon (:), a sequence  of
       items  which is the body of the rule, and a semicolon (;).  When a rule
       is called, it is executed by executing the individual items of the body
       in  order  (as modified by control structures) until either one of them
       explicitly terminates execution of the rule or the last	item  is  exe-
       cuted.
<p>
       An  item which is an input token requires that that token appear in the
       input at that point, and accepts it (causing it to be emitted  as  out-
       put).
<p>
       An  item  which	is an identifier denotes a call to another rule, which
       executes the body of that rule and then returns to the caller.	It  is
       an error to call a nonexistent rule.
<p>
       An  item  which is an identifier preceded by `!' causes that identifier
       to be emitted as an action token; the identifier has no other  signifi-
       cance.
<p>
       An item which is `&lt;&lt;' causes execution of the current rule to terminate
       immediately, returning to the calling rule.
<p>
       An item which is `>>' causes the execution of the  innermost  enclosing
       loop  (see  below)  to terminate immediately, with execution continuing
       after the end of that loop.  The loop must be within the same rule.
<p>
       An item which is an identifier preceded by `@%&!'  causes  an  internal
       semantic  action  to  be  executed  within the parser; this is normally
       needed only for bizarre situations like C's typedef.  [xxx should  give
       details I suppose]
<p>
       A  choice  is  a  sequence of branches enclosed in parentheses (()) and
       separated by vertical bars (|).	The first of the branches that can  be
       executed,  is,  after  which  execution	continues after the end of the
       choice.
<p>
       A loop is a sequence of branches enclosed in braces ({}) and  separated
       by  vertical bars (|).  The first of the branches that can be executed,
       is, and this is done repeatedly until the loop is terminated  by  `>>',
       after which execution continues after the end of the loop.  (A loop can
       also be terminated by `&lt;&lt;' terminating execution of the whole rule.)
<p>
       A branch is just a sequence of items, like a rule body, except that  it
       must  begin  with  either  an input token or a lookahead.  If it begins
       with an input token, it can be executed only when  that	token  is  the
       next  token  in the input, and execution starts with acceptance of that
       token.
<p>
       A lookahead specifies conditions for execution of  a  branch  based  on
       recognizing  but  not  accepting  input token(s).  The simplest form is
       just an input token enclosed in brackets ([]), in which case  execution
       of  that  branch  is possible only when that token is the next token in
       the input.  The brackets can also contain multiple input  tokens  sepa-
       rated  by  commas,  in  which  case  the  parser looks for any of those
       tokens.	If a user-abbreviation class name appears, either by itself or
       as  an  element	of  a  comma-separated list, it stands for the list of
       tokens given in its definition.
<p>
       If a lookahead's brackets contain only a `*', this is a default branch,
       executable regardless of the state of the input.
<p>
       As  a  very  special case, a lookahead's brackets can contain two input
       tokens separated by slash (/), in which case that branch is  executable
       only  when those two tokens, in sequence, are next in the input.  Warn-
       ing: this is implemented by a delicate perversion of  the  error-repair
       machinery,  and	if the first of those tokens is not then accepted, the
       parser will die in convulsions.	A further restriction is that the same
       input token may not appear as the first token of a double lookahead and
       as a normal lookahead token in the same choice/loop.
<p>
       Certain simple choice/loop structures appear frequently, and there  are
       abbreviations for them:
<pre>
abbreviation	    expansion
( items ?)	        ( items  |  [*] )
{ items ?}	        { items  |  [*] >> }
( ! [look] items ?) ( [ look]  |  items )
{ ! [look] items ?} { [ look] >>  |  items }
</pre>
<p>
       For  example,  here  are  the rules of the AASL specification for AASL,
       minus the actions (which add considerable clutter and are  unintelligi-
       ble without the third pass):
<pre>
	       rules: {
				   "id" ":" contents ";"
				   | "&lt;" "id" ">" {"string" ?} ";"
				   | "string" "->" "string"
				   | "EOF" >>
	       };
	       contents: {
				   ">>"
				   | "&lt;&lt;"
				   | "id"
				   | "!" "id"
				   | "@%&!" "id"
				   | "string"
				   | "(" branches ")"
				   | "{" branches "}"
				   | [*] >>
	       };
	       branches: (
				   "!" "[" look "]" contents "?"
				   | [*] branch (
				   ["|"] {"|" branch ?}
				   | "?" !endbranch
				   | [*]
				   )
	       );
	       branch: (
				   "string" contents
				   | "[" look "]" contents
	       );
	       look: (
				   ["string"/"/"] "string" "/" "string"
				   | "*"
				   | [*] looker {"," looker ?}
	       );
	       looker: ( "string" | "id" ) ;
</pre>
<h2>Error Repair</h2>
<p>
       When  the  input  token is not one of those desired, either because the
       item being executed is an input token and a different token appears  on
       the  input,  or	because  none of the branches of a choice/loop is exe-
       cutable, error repair is invoked to try to fix things up.  Sometimes it
       can  actually  guess  right  and  fix the error, but more frequently it
       merely supplies a legal output so that later passes will not be	thrown
       into chaos by a minor syntax error.
<p>
       The  general  error-repair  strategy  of  an AASL parser is to give the
       parser what it wants and then attempt to resynchronize the  input  with
       the parser.
<p>
       [xxx  long discussion of how ``what it wants'' is determined when there
       are multiple possibilities]
<p>
       Resynchronization is  performed	in  three  stages.   The  first  stage
       attempts to resynchronize within a logical line, and is applied only if
       neither the input token nor the desired token is a line	terminator  (a
       member  of  the	``lineterm'' class).  If the input token is trivial (a
       member of the ``trivial'' class), it is	discarded.   Otherwise	it  is
       retained,  in hopes that it will be the next token that the parser asks
       for.
<p>
       Either way, an error message is produced, indicating what was  desired,
       what was seen, and what was handed to the parser.  If too many of these
       messages have been produced for a single line,  the  parser  gives  up,
       produces a last despairing message, emits a ``#!aargh'' action token to
       alert later pases, and exits.  Barring this disaster, parsing then con-
       tinues.	 If  the  parser  at some point is willing to accept the input
       token, it is accepted and error repair terminates.  If a line  termina-
       tor  is seen in input, or the parser requests one, before the parser is
       willing to accept the input token, the second phase begins.
<p>
       The second stage of resynchronization attempts to line both  input  and
       parser  up on a line terminator.  If the desired token is a line termi-
       nator and the input token is not, input is discarded until a line  ter-
       minator appears.  If the desired token is not a line terminator and the
       input token is, the input token is retained and parsing continues until
       the  parser  asks  for  a line terminator.  Either way, the third phase
       then begins.
<p>
       The third stage of resynchronization attempts to reconcile line	termi-
       nators.	If the desired and input tokens are identical, the input token
       is accepted and error repair terminates.  If they are not identical and
       the  input  token is trivial (yes, line terminators can be trivial, and
       ones like `;' probably should be), the input token  is  discarded.   If
       the  desired token is the endmarker, then the input token is discarded.
       Otherwise, the input token continues to be retained in  hopes  that  it
       will  eventually  be  accepted.	 [xxx  this needs more thought] In any
       case, the second phase begins again.

       Written	at  University	of  Toronto  by Henry Spencer, somewhat in the
       spirit of S/SL (see ACM TOPLAS April 1982).
<h2>
Bugs</h2>
<p>
       Some of the restrictions on double lookahead are annoying.
<p>
       Most of the C string escapes are recognized but disregarded, with  only
       a backslashed double-quote interpreted properly during text generation.
<p>
       Error repair needs further tuning; it has an annoying tendency to infi-
       nite-loop  in  certain odd situations (although the messages/line limit
       eventually breaks the loop).
<p>
       Complex choices/loops with many branches can result in very long  lines
       in the table.
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>
The implementation of AASL was fairly straight forward, with AASL
itself used to describe its own syntax. An AASL specification is
compiled into a table, which is then processed by a table-walking
interpreter.  The interpreter expects input to be as tokens, one
per line, much likethe output of a traditional scanner.  A complete
program using AASL (for example, the AASL table generator) is
normally three passes: thescanner,the parser (tables plus interpreter),
and a semantics pass. The first set of tables was generated byhand
for bootstrapping.
<p>
Apart from the minor nuisance of repeated iterations of language
design, the biggest problem ofimplementing AASL wasthe question of
semantic actions. Inserting awk semantic routines into the table
interpreter, in the style of yacc,would not be impossible, but it
seemed clumsy and inelegant. Awks lack of anyprovision for compile
time initialization of tables strongly suggested reading them in at
run time, rather than taking up space with a huge BEGIN action whose
only purpose was to initialize the tables. This makes insertions into
the interpreters code awkward.
<p>
The problem was solved by a crucial observation: traditional compilers
(etc.) merge a two-stepprocess, first validating a token stream and
inserting semantic action cookiesinto it, then interpreting thestream
and the cookies to interface to semantics. Forexample, yaccs grammar
notation can be viewed asinserting fragments of C code into a parsed
output, and then interpreting that output. This approach yieldsan
extremely natural pass structure for an AASL parser,with the
parsersoutput stream being (in the absenceof syntax errors) a copy
of its input stream with annotations. The following semantic pass
then processesthis, momentarily remembering normal tokens and
interpreting annotations as operations on the remembered values.
(The semantic pass is, in fact, a classic pattern+action awk program,
with a pattern and anaction for each annotation, and a general save
the value in a variableaction for normal tokens.)
<p>
The one difficulty that arises with this method is when the language
definition involves feedbackloops between semantics and parsing,
an obvious example being Cs typedef.Dealing with this reallydoes
require some imbedding of semantics into the interpreter,although
with care it need not be much: thein-parser code for recognizing C
typedefs, including the complications introduced by block structure
andnested redeclarations of type names, is about 40 lines of awk.The
in-parser actions are invoked by a special variant of the AASL emit
semantic annotationsyntax.
<p>
Aside benefit of top-down parsing is that the context of errors is
known, and it is relatively easy to implement automatic error
recovery. When the interpreter is faced with an input token that
does not appearin the list of possibilities in the parser table,
it givesthe parser one of the possibilities anyway, and then usessimple
heuristics to try to adjust the input to resynchronize. The result
is that the parser,and subsequentpasses, always see a syntactically-correct
program. (This approach is borrowed from S/SL and its predecessors.)
Although the detailed error-recovery algorithm is still experimental,
and the current one is notentirely satisfactory when a complex AASL
specification does certain things, in general it deals with minorsyntax
errors simply and cleanly without anyneed for complicating the
specification with details of errorrecovery.Knowing the context of
errors also makes it much easier to generate intelligible error
messagesautomatically.
<p>
The AASL implementation is not large. The 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/bash/aasl//contents/lex">scanner</a> is 78 lines of
awk,the parser is 61 lines of AASL (using a fairly low-density
paragraphing style and a good manycomments), and the 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/bash/aasl/contents/sem">semantics pass</a>
is 290
lines of awk. The 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/bash/aasl/contents/interp">table interpreter</a> is 340 lines, about half
of which (and most of the complexity) can be attributed to the
automatic error recovery.
<p>
As an experiment with a more ambitious AASL specification, one for
ANSI C was written. This occupies 374 lines excluding comments and
blank lines, andwith the exception of the messy details of
Cdeclaratorsis mostly a fairly straightforward transcription of the
syntax given in the ANSI standard. Generating tables for this takes
about three minutes of CPU time on a Sun 3/180; the tables are about
10K bytes.
<p>
The performance of the resulting ANSI C parser is not impressive:
in very round numbers, averagedoveralarge program, it parses about
one line of C per CPU second. (The scanner,164 lines of awk, accounts
for a negligible fraction of this.) Some attention to optimization
of both the tables and the interpreter might speed this up somewhat,
but remarkable improvements are unlikely. As things stand in the absence
of better awk implementations or a rewrite of the table interpreter
in C, its a cute toy, possibly of some pedagogical value, but not a
useful production tool. On the other hand, there does not appear
to be any fundamental reason for the performance shortfall: itspurely
the result of the slowexecution of awk programs.

<h3>Lessons From AASL 
</h3>
<p>
The scanner would be much 
faster with better regular-expression matching, because it can use regular expressions to determine whether 
a string is a plausible token but must use substr
to extract the string first. Nawk functions would be very
handy for modularizing code, especially the complicated and seldom-invoked
error-recovery procedure. A
switch statement modelled on the pattern+action scheme would be useful in several places. 
<p>
Another troublesome issue is that arrays are second-class citizens in awk (and continue to be so in 
nawk): there is no array assignment. This lack leads to endless repetitions of code like: 
<pre>
for (i in array) 
    arraystack[i ":" sp] = array[i] 
</pre>
<p>
whenever
block structuring or a stack is desired. Nawk's multi-dimensional arrays supply some syntactic
sugar for this but don't
really fix the problem. Not only is this code clumsy, it is woefully inefficient compared 
to something like 
<pre>
arraystack[sp] = array 
</pre>
<p>
even if the implementation is very clever. This significantly reduces the usefulness of arrays as symboltables and the like, a role for which they are otherwise very well suited. 
<p>
It would also be of some use if there were some way to initialize arrays as constant tables, or alternatively 
a guarantee that the BEGIN action would be implemented cleverly and would not occupy space after 
it had finished executing. 
<p>
A
minor nuisance that surfaces constantly is that getting an error message
out to the standard-error descriptor is painfully clumsy: one gets to choose between putting error messages
out to a temporary file and having a shell "wrapper" process them later, or piping them into "cat >&amp;2" (!). 
<p>
The multi-pass input-driven
structure that awk naturally lends itself to produces very
clean and readable code with different phases neatly separated, but creates substantial difficulties 
when
feedback loops appear.
(In the case of AASL,this perhaps says more about language design than about 
awk.) <h2>Author</h2>
