#Generates random signtures. Signatures and generation code included
#in same file so installation is just a matter of calling one file.
#.P
#Most of the file is a large "here" document. Paragraph 1 of that
#document is always added to the signatures, followed one of
#the folowing paragraphs, selected at radonom.
#.P
#To add to the signtures, include them in the here document,
#with one preceeding blank line.
