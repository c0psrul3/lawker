About

   adoC is a source code documenting system written in awk and shell
   script. It produces documentation in LaTeX format which resembles the
   Unix man pages. The documentation is generated from comment sections
   in the source code. The comment sections are marked by two special
   character sequences and internally divided into sub- parts by
   keywords. The system can be used with almost any kind of programming
   language.

   The idea is based on ROBODoc
   [3]http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html

Requirements

   The system requires a working gawk and LaTeX installation. For the
   LaTeX document the "refart.sty" style should be installed.

Example

   adoC is documented by [4]itself .

   For the detailed documentation about the system and its implementation
   execute the following:
        adoc -s -t "adoc" adoc > doc.tex

   For the detailed documentation about the system and its implementation
   execute the following:
        $ adoc -s -t "adoc" adoc > doc.tex
        $ latex doc
        $ makeindex doc
        $ latex doc
        $ makeindex doc
        $ latex doc
        $ latex doc
        $ dvips doc

   The created documentation can be downloaded in Postscript format from
   [5]here.
