#.EM From Wikipedia:
#ELIZA was a computer program and an early example of (by modern standards) primitive natural language processing. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to scripts, the most famous of which was DOCTOR, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. In this mode, ELIZA mostly rephrased the user's statements as questions and posed those to the 'patient.' ELIZA was written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966.
