THAT'S (nearly) ALL FOLKS

Today marks the end of 6 months of awk.info and, in
case you have not noticed, the pace of updates has
slowed right down.  Why? Well, I've run out of new cool
Awk examples to post to this site.

Clearly it is time for someone else to step up- someone
else who knows of other cool Awk apps.  I'm happy to
support anyone else who (a) knows of other examples of
cool Awk and (b) wants to take over the site. And
meanwhile I'll watch comp.lang.awk for any cool
updates.

So, volunteers anyone?

Enjoy!
