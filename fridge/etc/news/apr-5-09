Who said you can't use Awk for cutting edge research?
Yung-Pin Cheng's Awk-Linux system teaches operating
systems to univesrity students.  A major advantange of
the use of Awk for this tool is platform independence.
Stable Awk versions run on many platforms so this tool
can be readily and easily ported to other machines. The
same can not be said for other, more complex operating
systems courseware that may be much harder to port to
new environments.

Awk-Linux is a state-of-the-art tool.  See Yung-Pin
Cheng, Janet Mei-Chuen Lin, Awk-Linux: A Lightweight
Operating Systems Courseware IEEE Transactions on
Education, vol.  51, issue 4, pp.  461-467, 2008.

5) Page of the week

http://awk.info/?awk100/006boris

Ladies and gentlemen, a star is born. For a record
breadking third week, Google Analytics tells us that
"Boris" (demonstration  to DoD of a clustering
algorithm suitable for streaming  data) is STILL our
page of the week.

The code shows the power of Awk.  Write the code as
quick as you can, then look for quirks that can be
exploited to spped things up.  In the case of Boris,
those quirks turned a O(n^4) problem into a O(nlogn)
with a few judicious uses of constants.

Congrats, once again, to Ronald Loui and the man known
only as Boris.

Enjoy!
:-)

p.s. Awk.info wants to show to the world your great awk
code.  If you want to improve the above, or you have
other code you are particularly proud of (which you can
share), please see http://awk.info/?awk100 or
