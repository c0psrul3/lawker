PAGE OF THE MONTH

Google Analytics reports that last month, two of our pages
are most-accessed.

  1) http://awk.info/?tools/server
  2) http://awk.info/?tip/sedInAwk

The first is Michael Sander's simple, single user, web 
server built with gawk. Note that Michael has updated 
that server- see the AWK FAQ.

The second is an oldie but a goodie where Ed Morton shows
us how Awk can simplify numerous complex sed expressions.

--------

Have a nice new decade!
