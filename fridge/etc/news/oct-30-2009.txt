PAGE OF THE MONTH

           http://awk.info/?tools/fsm

This is Wm Miller's finite state machine generator,
Fsm.awk is an awk script designed to read a finite
state machine (fsm) specification and produce C files
which implement that fsm.  The chief benefit of using
fsm.awk is that it is easy to read, consistent state
machine specifications and reuse of existing, and
tested code.  Multiple tables and multiple users are
happily accommodated. Fsm.awk  provides an easy avenue
to generalization and consistency where fsms are
required.

Enjoy!
