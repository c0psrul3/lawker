----------------------------------------------------------
1) Fun with Awk

http://awk.info/?readminds

Claude Shannon's classic mind-reading machine.  I've
run this one for my friends and after a few rounds of
Awk guessing their next move, they backed off saying
"errr.. that's kind of creepy".

-------------------------------------------------------------
2) http://awk.info/?Sed
   - New section: writing sed clones in Awk

2a) http://awk.info/?doc/tip/awksed.html
    - Arnold Robbins turns Awk into a stream editor.

2b) http://awk.info/?doc/s2a.html
    - James Lyons converts Sed scripts to Awk.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3) New entries for the Awk100
(the Awk100  project collects impressive Awk programs.)

http://awk.info/?tools/awf

Henry Spencer's amazing Awk test formatter.  Awf
formats the text from the input file(s) (standard input
if none) in an imitation of nroff's style with the -man
or -ms macro packages.

Awf may not be lightning fast, and it has certain
restrictions, but it does a decent job on most manual
pages and simple -ms documents, and isn't subject to
AT&T's brain-damaged licensing that denied many System
V users any text formatter at all. 

It is also a text formatter that is simple enough to be
tinkered with, for people who want to experiment.

Finally, it shows that Awk is not just a language for
one-liners.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) Bits and Bytes of awk

4a) http://awk.info/?news/runawk016
	- Aleksey Cheusov updates his Runawk tool

4b) http://awk.info/?tip/moving
	- Arnold Robbins shows how to 
      push files around, with Awk.

4c) http://awk.info/?tip/caltricks
    - Walter Ferlazzo tames the Unix "cal" command.

----------------------------------------------------------
5) Page of the week

http://awk.info/?advocacy

Google Analytics tells us that the Awk.info
"Why Awk?" page is top of pops. What does that
mean? I'm only guessing here,  but maybe some folks
are reevaluating what they want from their
scripting tools and what Awk can offer, relative
to other tools. The more Awk.info collects large
and impressive Awk programs, the more it shows
that Awk is not just a language for one-liners
(e.g. see http://awk.info/?tools/awf).

----------------------------------------------------------
6) Link Attack

If you like what you are reading at Awk.info, please
help increase its PageRank statistics:

- Link to the site from your own pages 

- Or, where appropriate, add comments at other 
  sites that link to Awk.Info.

But please, no robot storms- reasonable linking only.

----------------------------------------------------------
7) Mystery

Google Analytics reports that in all of Florida, there
is only one place that reads Awk.info. And someone at
that site is reading these pages more frequently that
most of Europe.

Would the mysterious reader at Oldsmar Florida please
email me and let me know what is so good/bad about this
site?

--------

Enjoy!
