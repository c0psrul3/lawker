<h2>Abstract</h2>
<b>Programming by Demonstration</b> (PBD) systems often 
have problems with control structure injerence 
and user-intended generalization. We propose 
a new solution for these weaknesses basred on 
concepts of AWK and present a prototype system for text processing. It utilizes <em>vertical 
demonstration</em>, extensive visual feedback, and 
program visualization via spreadsheets to 
achieve improved usability and expressive 
power. 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In text editing users are often confronted 
with reformatting tasks which involve large 
portions of texts, sometimes consisting of hundreds of lines. For example, let us assume we 
want to create mailing labels out of a 
given address list. The task seems to 
be easy to automat since all paragraphs are 
similarly structured, containing a name, an 
address, and a phone number e:ach. 
However, both the built-in find and replace 
function and the macro recorder of the editor 
prove to be not flexible enough to handle the 
task, because their facilities for specifying 
search patterns and for dealing with special 
cases and exceptions are limited. 
<p>
On the other hand, most current end-uslers estimate solving such tasks with one of today's 
programming languages as too difficult for 
them. 
Programming by Demonstration (PBD) is a 
promising remedy here  since, by contrast, 
it promises nearly unlimited prograrnming 
power though ease of learning and usage. 
Therefore, a variety of PBD systems were 
proposed for this application domain  in 
the past. But PBD is not yet very widespread in 
commercial text editors because of some serious weaknesses. 
<p>
This paper examines these weaknesses 
and present a new approach for the solution of 
the deficiencies of PBD. We introduce Visual 
AWK, a prototype text processing system developed at the Information Systems Lab of 
Hiroshima University based on the programming language AWK  which incorporates 
the new design approach. Extensive visual 
feedback and program visualization via spreadsheets improve both usability and expressive 
power. 
<p>
Visual AWK is aimed at users without previous knowledge in programming, but with ex- 
perience in text editor use. 
The application domain are semi-structured 
texts. That is, texts that consist of equally structured entities, for instance lines or paragraphs, 
but may contain a few syntactically classifiable 
sets of exceptions with a different structure.
