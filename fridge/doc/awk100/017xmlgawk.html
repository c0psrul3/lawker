<h2> Purpose</h2> <p>
Extends standard gawk with built-in XML processing.

<h2> Developers </h2> <p>
Jurgen Kahrs
and many others.


<h2> Domain </h2> <p>
XML processing, plus libraries for other extensions to Gawk.

<h2> Description </h2><p>
XMLgawk is an experimental extension of the GNU Awk interpreter.
It includes a small XML parsing library which is built upon the
Expat XML parser. The parsing library is a very thin layer on top
of Expat (implementing a pull-interface) and can also be used without
GNU Awk to read XML data files.
<p>
Both, XMLgawk and its XML puller
library only require an ANSI C compatible compiler (GCC works, as
do most vendors' ANSI C compilers) and a 'make' program.

<p>
XMLgawk provides the following functionality including:
<ul>
<li> AWK's way of reading data line by line is supplemented by reading XML files node by node.
   <li> XMLgawk can load .awk file as <em>as well as</em> shared libraries.
   <li> Adds support for an @include directive in the source code. This is the same feature provided by the current igawk script. 
</ul>
