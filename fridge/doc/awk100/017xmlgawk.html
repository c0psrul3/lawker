<em>Editor's note:
Programmers often take awk "as is", never thinking to use it as a lab in which
they can explore other language extensions. 
An alternate approach is to treat the Awk code base as a reusable library
of parsers, regular expression engines, etc etc and to make modifications
to the lanugage. This second approach is taken in the <a href="http://awk.info/?awkastar">Awk A*</a>
project and, as shown here, in XMLgawk.
<p>
IMHO,
XMLgawk is one of the most exciting new innovations 
seen in Gawk for many years. 
It shows that Awk is more than "just" a text processor: rather
it is also a  candidate technology for modern XML-based web applications.

<h2> Purpose</h2> <p>
Extends standard gawk with built-in XML processing.

<h2> Developers </h2> <p>

Main developers: Jurgen Kahrs and Andrew Schorr.

<p>Conceptual guidance: Manuel Collado.

<p>MS Windows build expert: Victor Paeza.

<p>Contributor of ideas for new features: Peter Saveliev.


<h2> Domain </h2> <p>
XML processing, plus libraries for other extensions to Gawk.

<h2> Description </h2><p>
XMLgawk is an experimental extension of the GNU Awk interpreter.
It includes a small XML parsing library which is built upon the
Expat XML parser. The parsing library is a very thin layer on top
of Expat (implementing a pull-interface) and can also be used without
GNU Awk to read XML data files.
<p>
Both, XMLgawk and its XML puller
library only require an ANSI C compatible compiler (GCC works, as
do most vendors' ANSI C compilers) and a 'make' program.

<p>
XMLgawk provides the following functionality including:
<ul>
<li> AWK's way of reading data line by line is supplemented by reading XML files node by node.
   <li> XMLgawk can load .awk file as <em>as well as</em> shared libraries.
   <li> Adds support for an @include directive in the source code. This is the same feature provided by the current igawk script. 
</ul>
