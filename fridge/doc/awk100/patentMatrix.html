<P> BACKGROUND: The number of patents associated with genes and
proteins and the amount of information contained in each patent
often present a real obstacle to the rapid evaluation of the novelty
of findings associated to genes from an intellectual property (IP)
perspective. This assessment, normally carried out by expert patent
professionals, can therefore become cumbersome and time consuming.
Here we present PatentMatrix, a novel software tool for the automated
analysis of patent sequence text entries. 

<p>METHODS AND RESULTS:
PatentMatrix is written in the Awk language and requires installation
of the Derwent GENESEQtrade mark patent sequence database under the
sequence retrieval system SRS.The software works by taking as input
two files: i) a list of genes or proteins with the associated
GENESEQtrade mark patent sequence accession numbers ii) a list of
keywords describing the research context of interest (e.g. 'lung',
'cancer', 'therapeutics', 'diagnostics'). The GENESEQtrade mark
database is interrogated through the SRS system and each patent
entry of interest is screened for the occurrence of user-defined
keywords. Moreover, the software extracts the basic information
useful for a preliminary assessment of the IP coverage of each
patent from the GENESEQtrade mark database. As output, two tab-delimited
files are generated which provide the user with a detailed and an
aggregated view of the results.An example is given where the IP
position of five genes is evaluated in the context of 'development
of antibodies for cancer treatment'.

<p>CONCLUSION: PatentMatrix allows
a rapid survey of patents associated with genes or proteins in a
particular area of interest as defined by keywords. It can be
efficiently used to evaluate the IP-related novelty of scientific
findings and to rank genes or proteins according to their IP position.
