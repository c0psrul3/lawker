<h2> Description </h2><p>

Most well-known instructional operating systems are complex, 
particularly if their companion software is taken into account. 
It takes considerable time and effort to craft these systems, 
and their complexity may introduce maintenance and evolution problems. 
In this project, a courseware called Awk-Linux is proposed. 
The basic hardware functions provided by Awk-Linux include timer interrupt and page-fault interrupt,
which are simulated through program instrumentation over user programs. 
<P>
A major advantange of the use of Awk for this tool is platform independence. 
Awk-Linux can be crafted relatively more easily and 
it does not depend on any hardware simulator or platform. 
Stable
Awk versions run on many platforms so  this tool can be readily and easily ported to other machines. 
The same can <em>not</em> be said for other, more complex operating systems courseware that may be
much harder to port to new environments.
<p>
In practice, using Awk-Linux is very simple for the instructor and students:
<ul>
<li>Course projects based on Awk-Linux provides source code extracted and 
simplified from a Linux kernel. 
<lI>Results of our study indicate that the 
projects helped students better to understand inner workings of operating systems.
</ul>
