<h2> Purpose</h2> <p>
AI Programming lab class challenge .

<h2> Installation </h2> <p>
Download from <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/bash/soccer.zip">LAWKER</a>.
Look at the first line of each file for something that looks like thos:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/gawk -f
</pre>
Replace this with the full path to the local version of Gawk.

<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
<em>Ronald Loui writes</em>: Most people are surprised when I tell them what language we use in our undergraduate AI programming class. That's understandable. We use GAWK. GAWK, Gnu's version of Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan's old pattern scanning language

This code manages a CGI interface to a process that simulates a soccer game, polling for inputs from two student programs.
<p>
A repeated observation in this class is that only the scripting programmers can generate code fast enough to keep up with the demands of the class. Even though students were allowed to choose any language they wanted, and many had to unlearn the java ways of doing things in order to benefit from scripting, there were few who could develop ideas into code effectively and rapidly without scripting. 
<p>
In the puny language, GAWK, which Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan thought not much more important than grep or sed, 
<a href="http://awk.info/?awk4ai">I find lessons in AI's trends, Airs history, and the foundations of AI</a>. 
What I have found not only surprising but also hopeful, is that when I have approached the AI people who still enjoy
programming, 
some of them are not the least bit surprised. 
<h2> Awk </h2><p>

Was written for gawk in 1995 but should run on almost any awk dialect; some css positioning commands will not work in all browsers; try IE6.

<h2> Platform  </h2><p>

Was written on Redhat Linux with multiple hardware platforms in mind.

<h2> Uses </h2><p>

Intended to be run on close server to minimize delays.

<h2> Lines </h2><p>

605 lines in main cgi with several small aux control programs.

<h2> DevelopmentEffort </h2><p>
Minimal compared to development effort, but potentially will require css for new browsers.

<h2> MaintenanceEffort </h2> <p>

Number of person-months since, including enhancements

<h2> Current</h2> <p>

2=Evaluation.

<h2> Users </h2><p>

50 students in artificial intelligence project classes had to use some version of this code over seven years

<h2> DateDeployed </h2><p>

October 2004

<h2> Dated </h2><p>
