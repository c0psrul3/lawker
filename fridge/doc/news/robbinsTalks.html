<h1><join>Interview with Aharon Robbins</join></h1>
<p>Aharon Robbins, the maintainer for GNU Awk maintainer, answers some questions from Tim Menzies.
<p><em>
Q: What is your favorite programming language (besides gawk)? And why?
</em>
<ul>
<p>A: 
It depends for what.  A long time ago I was a big Korn shell junkie,
although these days I would do most high level things in a mixture
of bash and awk, with awk doing the heavy lifting.
<p>
For lower level things I prefer C++, although I have something of
a love/hate relationship with the language. It's possible to write
completely unreadable and unmaintainable code in it.  It's also possible
to write beautiful, clear, absolutely amazing code in it.
<p>
I find that going back to C after working daily in C++ is hard, although
I do it for gawk maintenance.  For new programs I would work in C++,
not C. For something big, I'd use the Qt framework for support and
portability.
<p>
I've been recently living in the C# world for my day job.  The development
environment is very addictive, but C# hasn't seduced me away from C++.
</ul>
<p><em>
Q:
  The open source world is a fascinating development paradigm. I'm
therefore very curious to know what prompted  you to write gawk?
</em><ul>
<p>
A: I didn't write it from scratch.  I got involved shortly after picking
up and reading the Aho, Weinberger &amp;  Kernighan book in late 1987 when
it came out.
<p>
New awk wasn't widely available. I had been involved with USENET since
around 1983, and knew about the GNU project. I also had a strong interest
in compilers and interpreters, so I got in touch with the GNU project
to see if they had an awk clone and to see if I could get involved in
upgrading it to "new" awk.
<p>
It turned out that they already had a volunteer, David Trueman, who was
working on it, but he was happy to have help.  He and I worked together
until circa 1993 or 1994 when he had to stop being involved, and I became
the sole maintainer.
<p>
It was a lot of fun.  The number of emails of the "I could not get my
work done without gawk" sort was amazing; Unix awk would often roll over
and die on some of the data sets people were running though gawk.
<p>
Things really got shaken down when gawk became part of GNU/Linux
distributions; then people were using it as the only awk, instead of
alongside Unix awk.
</ul>
<p>
<em>
Q: In retrospect, what are the best/worst features of gawk?
</em><ul>
<p>
A: The best feature is the pattern/action paradigm. The implicit
read-a-record loop is wonderful.  This is the language's data-driven
nature, as opposed to the imperative nature of most languages.
<p>
Associative arrays rank second; they are quite powerful.
<p>
There are some warts inherited from Unix awk and left unspecified
by POSIX.  These are relatively minor.
<p>
The lack of an explicit concatenation operator is an obvious one.
<p>
The lack of real multi-dimensional arrays is another.
<p>
There are features just in gawk that in retrospect seem to have been a
waste of time, such as bringing out to the awk level the possibility to
internationalize a program.  I don't think anyone uses that.
<p>
IGNORECASE was a huge pain to get right; if I'd known how long it would
take, I wouldn't have bothered.
<p>
The biggest "lack" is that there isn't an easy, standard way to provide
extensibility; there are way too many things in the C library today (and
even yesterday) that the awk programmer just can't get to. (Like the
chdir system call!) I hope to eventually provide some better mechanisms
for this, but I don't know how much actual filling in I can do also.
</ul>
<p><em>
Q:  Under what circumstances would you recommend/not recommend it?</em>
<ul>
<p>
A: Gawk is good for small to medium level programs that have to process text
and/or do simple numeric work (summing up columns, averaging, VERY simple
statistics work).  It has a central place in traditional Unix / Linux
shell scripting when portability is a must.
<p>
But I wouldn't care to try to write a military air traffic command and
control system in gawk, for example. :-)
</ul>
<p>
<em>Q:   Gawk has a reputation of being slow...</em>
<ul>
<p>A:
"Slow" compared to what?  As far as I've
seen, gawk is always faster than Unix awk.  Michael Brennan's mawk is
even faster, but until recently it has been unmaintained, and it lacks
many important, modern features.
<p>
Relative to C?  Of course. So what?  You have to write 5 - 10 times as
much C as you do awk to do the same or less. (I remember one program I
wrote in C at around 1200 lines and rewrote in under 300 lines of awk,
and the awk was clearer and did more.)
<p>
Relative to perl?  It depends.  I have had emails telling me that gawk was
faster than perl for what the users were doing.  And if not, do I care?
Not really - perl is a write-only language, and don't get me started on
Perl 6. :-)
<p>
All that said, this got me to thinking about a possible bottleneck that
I'll be investigating in the near future.
</ul>
<p><em>
Q: Awk also has a reputation of 
 not being suitable for "real"
 projects. Is that reputation deserved?
</em>
<ul>
<p>
A: I don't think that contention is true: it may be that scripting languages
in general have such a reputation - Ronald Loui has written about this,
but I don't think the contention is true for scripting languages either.
<p>
As is always the case, the answer is "it depends".  What is the scale
of what you're trying to do?  Who is the customer?  When Rick Adams
was still running UUNET, he used a suite of awk programs to do his
accounting. That's as "real" a project as you can get: billing your
(hundreds or thousands of) customers for their resource usage.  And he
used gawk, since Unix awk would just roll over and die.  (Unix awk has
gotten better as a result of the "competition", but that's a different
story. :-)
</ul>
<p>
<em>Q:  Are you aware of any landmark projects that use gawk?</em>
<ul><p>
A:
GNU/Linux.  :-)
<p>
Not really.  Gawk "just works", and that in and of itself is a testimony
to its quality and value.
</ul>
<p><em>
Q: Looking a decade into the future, can  you see gawk disappearing? Why (not)?</em>
<ul>
<p>
A: I don't think so.  The bigger question is will I still be involved with it 10
years from now?  I don't know.
<p>
I still have some things I'd like to see happen with it that are interesting
and valuable and may even end up being relatively unique.  I just have to
find the time (or some other volunteers :-) to work on them.
</ul>
<p>
<em>Q: Currently, how are you filling your time?</em>
<ul>
<p>
A: I have a full time job as a software engineer with Intel.  I have a wife and
four wonderful children, as well as a dog.  That's enough right there to keep
me busy.
<p>
I am the series editor for the Prentice Hall Open Source Software Development
Series which also takes some of my time.
<p>
And I still try to do some gawk work in between everything else!
</ul>
