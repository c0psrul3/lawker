<h1><join>New release: RUNAWK 0.17</join></h1>
<h2>What is RUNAWK?
</h2>
<p>
  RUNAWK is a small wrapper for the AWK interpreter that helps one write
  standalone AWK scripts. Its main feature is to provide a
  module/library system for AWK which is somewhat similar to Perl's
  "use" command. It also allows you to select a preferred AWK
  interpreter and to setup the environment for your scripts. RUNAWK
  makes programming AWK easy and efficient. RUNAWK also provides many
  useful AWK modules.

Major Changes</h2>
<p>
 Version 0.17.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Sep 2009
<p>
 runawk:
    <ul><li> ADDED: new option for runawk for #use'ing modules: -f.
      runawk can also be used for oneliners! ;-)
<pre>
      runawk -f abs.awk -e 'BEGIN {print abs(-123); exit}'
</pre>
    <li> In a multilined code passed to runawk using option -e, spaces
      are allowed before #directives.

    <li> After inventing alt_getopt.awk module there is no reason for
      heuristics that detects whether to add `-' to AWK arguments or
      not. So I've removed this heuristics. Use alt_getopt.awk module
      or other "smart" module for handling options correctly!
</ul>
<p>
 alt_getopt.awk and power_getopt.awk:
    <ul><li> FIX: for "abc:" short options specifier BSD and GNU getopt(3)
      accept "-acb" and understand it as "-a -cb", they also accept
      "-ac b" and also translate it to "-a -cb". Now alt_getopt.awk
      and power_getopt.awk work the same way.
	</ul>
<p>
 power_getopt.awk:
    <ul><li> -h option doesn't print usage information, --help (and its short
      synonym) does.
	</ul>
<p>
 New modules:
    <ul>
	<li> shquote.awk, implementing shquote() function.<br>
        <em>shquote(str):</em>
<ul>
            `shquote' transforms the string `str' by adding shell
            escape and quoting characters to include it to the
            system() and popen() functions as an argument, so that
            the arguments will have the correct values after being
            evaluated by the shell.
</ul>
        Inspired by NetBSD's shquote(3) from libc.

    <li> runcmd.awk, implementing functions runcmd1() and xruncmd1()<br>
        <em>runcmd1(CMD, OPTS, FILE):</em>
<ul>
            wrapper for function system() that runs a command CMD
            with options OPTS and one filename FILE.  Unlike
            system(CMD " " OPTS " " FILE) the function runcmd1()
            handles correctly FILE and CMD containing spaces, single
            quote, double quote, tilde etc.
</ul>
    <li>    <em>xruncmd1(FILE):</em>
	<ul>
            safe wrapper for 'runcmd(1)'.
            awk exits with error if running command failed.
	</ul>
	<li>
     isnum.awk, implementing trivial isnum() function,
            see the source code.
	<li>
     alt_join.awk, implementing the following functions:<br>
        <em>join_keys(HASH, SEP):</em>
		<ul>
            returns string consisting of all keys from HASH separated
            by SEP.
	</ul>
        <em>join_values(HASH, SEP):</em>
	<ul>
            returns string consisting of all values from HASH separated
            by SEP.
</ul>
        <em>join_by_numkeys (ARRAY, SEP [, START [, END]]):</em>
	<ul>
            returns string consisting of all values from ARRAY
            separated by SEP. Indices from START (default: 1) to END
            (default: +inf) are analysed. Collecting values is stopped
            on index absent in ARRAY. 
	</ul>
</ul>
