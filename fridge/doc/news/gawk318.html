<h1><join>Gawk 3.1.8: ready (nearly)</join></h1>

<p> 
OK folks, after much more work than I expected (and it's *always* much
more work than I expect), I'm announcing a public very-late-beta of
what will become gawk 3.1.8:
<ul>

<a href="http://www.skeeve.com/gawk/gawk-3.1.7i.tar.gz">httxsp://www.skeeve.com/gawk/gawk-3.1.7i.tar.gz</a>
</ul>
<p>
Of major note is that the dfa matcher is very closely in sync with
what's in the GNU grep git tree; there are a number of improvements in
it and we can hope that regex matching in multibyte locales is now
faster than before.
<p>
Try this out, and let me know if you find something that doesn't work.
<p>
PLEASE just <a href="mailto:arnold@skeeve.com">email me</a> 
directly; relying on the newsgroup is not the
best course.
<p>
Thanks,<br>
