<H1><join>How to Call Awk from "C" with Libmawk</join> </H1>
<p>
Libmawk is a fork of mawk 1.3.3 restructured for embedding. This means the
user gets libmawk.h and libmawk.so and can embed awk scripting language
in any application written in C. 
<P>
the project can be downloaded<a href="http://repo.hu/projects/libmawk/download.html">
here</a>.

<H2> Features </H2>
<p>
Libmawk has the following main features:
<UL>
	<LI> load and run multiple awk scripts independently, in parallel
	<LI> scripts do not read stdin but a memory buffer the embedding process can fill from time to time
	<LI> running scripts in (mostly) non-blocking manner - that is, the script will not block if the process can not provide new input
	<LI> all these without threads or fork()
	<LI> call awk functions from C, using vararg for smooth integration
	<LI> call C functions from awk scripts
	<LI> resolve existing awk variables from C - read or write variables
</UL>


<H2> License </H2>
