<h2>About</h2>
<p>
 runawk is a small wrapper for the AWK interpreter that helps one
   write standalone AWK scripts. Its main feature is to provide a
   module/library system for AWK which is somewhat similar to Perl's
   "use" command. It also allows you to select a preferred AWK
   interpreter and to setup the environment for your scripts. It also
   provides other helpful features, for example it includes
   numerous useful of modules.

<h2>Major Changes IN RUNAWK-0.18.0</h2>
<p>
 Makefile:
<ul>
<li>
    "install-dirs" target has been renamed to "installdirs" 

    <li> At compile time MODULESDIR can contain a *list* of
      colon-separated directories,
      e.g. /usr/local/share/runawk:/usr/local/share/awk
<li>
     Support for multiply applied options, e.g. -vvv for increasing
      verbosity level. If option without arguments is multiply
      applied, getarg() function returns a number of times it was
      applied, not just 0 or 1.
</ul>
<p>
 New modules:
<ul><li>
     init_getopt.awk using alt_getopt.awk and used by power_getopt.awk.
      Its goal is to initialize `long_opts' and `long_opts' variables
      but not run `getopt' function.
<li>
     heapsort.awk  :  heapsort :-)
<li>
     quicksort.awk : quicksort :-)
<li>
     sort.awk      : either heapsort or quicksort,
                      the default is heapsort.
      Unfortunately GAWK's asort() and asorti() functions
      do *not* satisfy my needs. Another (and more important) reason
      is a portability.
</ul>
<p>
 Improvements, clean-ups and fixes in regression tests.
<p>
Also,
 runawk-0-18-0 was successfully tested on the following platforms:
    NetBSD-5.0/x86, NetBSD-2.0/alpha, OpenBSD-4.5/x86,
    FreeBSD-7.1/x86, FreeBSD-7.1/spark, Linux/x86 and
    Darwin/ppc.
