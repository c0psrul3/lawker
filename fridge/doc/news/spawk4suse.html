<h1><join>Spawk for SUSE Linux</join></h1>


<p>
I've just installed the openSUSE Milestone 8 (11.2) in a virtual machine in my PC.
<p>In about half an hour, I've also downloaded MySQL, gawk sources and SPAWK (SQL + AWK) sources, 
compiled and build the SPAWK  libraries (/usr/lib/libspawk.so and /usr/lib/libspawk_r.so).
<p>I've tested the module and worked just fine, so I've uploaded the binary tarball for this distro in SPAWK project 
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/spawk/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/spawk/downloads/list</a>).
<p>
Have a Happy New Year!<br>
