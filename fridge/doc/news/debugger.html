<h1><join>New Awk Debugger</join></h1>

I am pleased to announce the availability of a test version of gawk. 
This version uses a byte-code execution engine, and most importantly, 
it includes a debugger that works at the level of awk statements! The 
distribution is available at 
        <a href="http://www.skeeve.com/gawk/gawk-3.1.7-bc-d.tar.gz">http://www.skeeve.com/gawk/gawk-3.1.7-bc-d.tar.gz</a>.
<p>
This version is the same as 3.1.7, but with a new execution engine and 
a debugging version of gawk named, rather imaginatively, "dgawk". 
There is a story here.  Circa 2003, a gentleman by the name of Jon Haque 
developed the byte-code execution engine and debugger, in the context 
of a development gawk version, somewhere between 3.1.3 and 3.1.4. 
<p>I never integrated the changes as they were massive and I was busy, 
and I wasn't able to review them. 
<p>The changes languished, and Jon disappeared. 
<p>Last fall, Stephen Davies, one of my portability team members, agreed to 
take on the task of bringing the code into the present.  With modest help 
from me, he succeeded.  We then went through additional work to get this 
version portable to some of the more esoteric systems that gawk supports 
(64 bit Linux, z/OS and VMS). 
<p>I thought it was ready for release at the end of December, until another 
one of my testers found a severe memory leak in the byte code version. 
It was a bear to track down, and once again Stephen came through. 
The debugger uses the readline library, and it is purposely similar 
to GDB.  There is only minimal documentation on the debugger; I'd love 
to have someone volunteer to write a chapter for the gawk manual that 
explains it fully.
