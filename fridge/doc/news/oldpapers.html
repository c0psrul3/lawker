<h1><join>Gawk 3.1.8: ready (nearly)</join></h1>


<p>Attached, with permission from Brian Kernighan, are two items of
interest.

The first is a reconstituted version of the "Software: Practice and
Experience" paper on Awk published in 1979.  The second is a scan of
CSTR 118 from 1986 or so that is the first description of "new" awk.
