<h1><join>Classic Awk Papers</join></h1>


<p>Brian Kernighan has posted two classic Awk papers to awk.info:
<ul>
<li>
The first is a reconstituted version of the "Software: Practice and
Experience" paper on Awk published in 1979.  
<li>
The second is a scan of
CSTR 118 from 1986 or so that is the first description of "new" awk.
</ul>
