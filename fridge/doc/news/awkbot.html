Awkbot is a  small bot written in 100% GNU Awk, awkbot requires GNU Awk version 3.1.1.
<p>
Awkbot Has ability to search google, search the awk man page for descriptions of functions and built in variables. 
<p>The tool accepts a simple configuration file, and has a small wrapper written in sh for automatic restarts. 
<p>The goal of the tool is to (eventually) become a clone of info bot with awk adaptations to prove to those fools in #perl on freenode that awk really is a programming language 
<p>
AWKBot uses <a href="http://awk.info?tools/mysql">mysql.awk</a> to connect to, and query, a MySQL database where it will store information you give it, and recall it later. It also uses this to track karma points, and maybe more in the future.
It similarly uses some interesting pipelining to do IPC, to support awkpaste
