<h1><join>Awk Cook Book Project</join></h1>

<p><em>Tim Menzies writes...</em>

<p>Anyone interested in collaborating on an Awk Cook Book?  That we get published with (say) O'Reilly?

<p>After browsing the
excellent entries from the
PHP cookbook by 
David Sklar and Adam Trachtenberg, I think the following topics look relevant.

<p>But what other topics are useful/ simple/ practical/ etc?

<p>I propose the following timetable:
<ul>
<li>March 2010: 
	<ul>
	<li>Revise the following list of headings (making comments using the comment system, below);
	<li>Identify possible authors
	</ul>
<li>April 2010:
	<ul>
	<li>Every author writes 5 new entries (call them "yellow")
	</ul>
<li>May 2010:
	<ul>
	<li>Every author reviews 5 entries for other authors, to label them "green" (ok to go) or "red" (needs more work).
	<li>Every author writes 5 new entries (call them "yellow")
		<li>Try to interest new authors in the project.
	</ul>
<li>Repeat the above, till done.
</ul>
<p>So, according to that timetable, the first step is for everyone to jump in and propose topics. Looking forward to your input!
