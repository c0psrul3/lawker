<em>Nov 28, 2009</em>
<p>This site is moving up the page rankings:
<ul>
<li>Four months ago, typing "awk" into Google resulted in pages of output where the first mention of awk.info did not appear till half-way down page five.
<li>
Today, the same query finds "awk.info" on page two (in position 18). 
</ul>
<p>
Other indicators also look good. Since the site was launched (Feb 15, 2009), the number of visits 
has
been steadily increasing:

Apart from Granville West Virginia (where this site is administrated),
the three cities with the most  visits are:
<ul>
<li>London, England: 389 visits;
<li>Thessaloniki, Greece: 491 visits;  
<li>Athens, Greece: 640 visits. 
</ul>
<p>(BTW: Anyone got any ideas why these cities visit here so often?)
