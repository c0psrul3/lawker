<h1><join>Awk.info Gaining Popularity</join></h1>

<em>Nov 28, 2009</em>
<p>Four months ago, typing "awk" into Google resulted in pages of output where the first mention of awk.info did not appear till half-way down page five.
Today, the same query finds "awk.info" on page two (in position 18). So this site is moving up the page rankings.
<p>
Other indicators also look good. Since the site was launched (Feb 15, 2009), the number of visits 
has
been steadily increasing:

Apart from Granville West Virginia (where this site is administrated),
the three cities with the most  visit are:
<ul>
<li>London, England (389 visits)
<li>Thessaloniki, Greece (491 visits)  
<li>Athens, Greece (640 visits). 
</ul>
<p>(BTW: I am interested in anyone's theory 
as to
why these three cities take so many trips to awk.info.)
