<h1><join> Awk + ANSI-C = OO </join></h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>ooc is an awk program which reads
class descriptions and performs the
routine coding tasks necessary to do
object-oriented coding in ANSI C. 
<p>
The tool is exceptionally well documented in

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
ooc is a technique to do object-oriented programming (classes,
methods, dynamic linkage, simple inheritance, polymorphisms,
persistent objects, method existence testing, message forwarding,
exception handling, etc.) using ANSI-C.
<p>
ooc is a preprocessor to simplify the coding task by converting
class descriptions and method implementations into ANSI-C as required
by the technique. You implement the algorithms inside the methods
and the ooc preprocessor produces the boilerplate.
<p>
ooc consists of a shell script driving a modular awk script (with
provisions for debugging), a set of reports -- code generation
templates -- interpreted by the script, and the source of a root
class to provide basic functionality.  Everything is designed to
be changed if desired. There are manual pages, lots of examples,
among them a calculator based on curses and X11, and you can ask
me about the book.
<p>
ooc as a technique requires an ANSI-C system -- classic C would
necessitate substantial changes. The preprocessor needs a healthy
Bourne-Shell and "new" awk as described in Aho, Weinberger, and
Kernighan's book.
<p>
ooc was developed primarily to teach about object-oriented programming
without having to learn a new language. If you see how it is done
in a familiar setting, it is much easier to grasp the concepts and
to know what miracles to expect from the technique and what not.
Conceivably, the preprocessor can be used for production programming
but this was not the original intent. Being able to roll your own
object-oriented coding techniques has its possibilities, however...
<h2> Technical Details</h2>
<p>Most sources should be viewed with tab stops set at 4 characters.
<p>
The original system ran on NeXTSTEP 3.2 and older, ESIX (System
V) 4.0.4, and Linux 0.99.pl4-49. This rerelease was tested on MacOS X
version 10.1.2 and Solaris version 5.8. You need to review paths in the
script 'ooc/ooc' before running anything. Make sure the first line
of this script points to a Bourne-style shell. Also make sure that
the first line of '09/munch' points to a (new) awk.
<p>
The rereleased 'ooc' awk-programs have been tested with GNU awk versions
3.0.1 and 3.0.3. Previous versions did not support AWKPATH properly
(but this is not essential).
<p>
The makefiles could be smarter but they are naive enough for all
systems.  This is a heterogeneous system -- set the environment
variable $OSTYPE to an architecture-specific name. 'make' in the current
directory will create everything by calling 'make' in the various
subdirectories. Each 'makefile' includes 'make/Makefile.$OSTYPE', review
your 'make/Makefile.$OSTYPE' before you start.
<P>
The following make calls are supported throughout:
<pre>
make [all]	create examples
make test	[make and] run examples
make clean	remove all but sources
make depend	make dependencies (if makefile.$OSTYPE supports it)
</pre>
<p>
Make dependencies can be built with the -MM option of the GNU C
compiler.  They are stored in a file 'depend' in each subdirectory.
They should apply to all systems. 'makefile.$OSTYPE' may include a target
'depend' to recreate 'depend' -- check 'makefile.darwin1.4' for an
example.
