<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
My boss wants to put NOAA weather radar images in a looping presentation
that is displayed as 720 video on the 1040 LCD TV in the atrium.  He
couldn't figure out how to download the various layers needed, so he gave
me the task. Of course, I had a sample composite image for him in half an
hour.  It looked terrible on the TV: the writing came out as just a blur
and the county and state lines (single pixel mostly) were essentially
invisible.  Obviously, I could make my own 'cities' overlay, but no tools
I had would convert the 'counties' image to any usable vector format for
line resizing.
<p>
This afternoon, I wrote a gawk script that widens the lines in a 256 color
BMP version of the image - I can convert it back to a transparent
background GIF later.
<p>
The power and range of gawk never ceases to amaze me - a 42 line (pretty
printed) program was all it took. 
<p>
The script uses FS="" to convert the entire file into 331 078 single byte
fields.  The first 1078 went into a header string and printf()ed to the
outfile.  The rest went into a a pair of 550 row by 600 column arrays.
Then I looked at each pixel in the A array, and if it was not the
background color, made the four surrounding pixels in the B array the same
color, provided they were background color (not part of an existing line).
 Then I read out the array in order and printf()ed it to the outfile.  The
resulting overlay should be readable after changing the colors to make the
dark lines brighter and moving its location in the stack to be on top of
the other images.
<p>
There is one known flaw that I have no intention of addressing: lines that
do not intersect other lines grow longer by one pixel for each pass
through the program.
<h2>Code Fragments</h2>
<p>
While the actual code is proprietary, the following code snippets show most of the
idioms required to handle binaries.
<pre>
function Bytes2Number( String,  x, y, z, Number ) {
      x = split( String, Scratch, "" )
      Number = 0
      for( y = 1; y <= x; y++ ) {
              z = index( CharString, Scratch[ y ] ) -1
              Number = Number + z * (256^(x - y))
      }
      return Number
}
</pre>
<p>
The following code initializes the CharString variable needed by Bytes2Number.
<pre>
BEGIN{
     for( x = 0; x <= 255; x++ ) {
          CharString = CharString sprintf( "%c", x )
</pre>
<p>
The above code generates the list of bytes for the Bytes2Number function.
<pre>
     FS= ""
     RS = /ABC/
}
</pre>
<p>
Mote that the string "ABC" does not appear in any of the image files processed by this code. Hence, the above lines
means that the whole image ends up in one record.
<p>
The next block analyzes the header to extract useful information.
<pre>
    {     Width   = Bytes2Number( $22 $21 $20 $19 )
          Height  = Bytes2Number( $26 $25 $24 $23 )
          Data    = Bytes2Number( $14 $13 $12 $11 )
          Size    = Bytes2Number( $6 $5 $4 $3 )
          Depth   = Bytes2Number( $30 $29 ) / 8
          ImgSize = Bytes2Number( $38 $37 $36 $35 )
           ....
    }
</pre>
<p>
(note: I found that the image size in the header may be wrong, notably in files resized by Paint Shop Pro. Calculating it proved more reliable.)
