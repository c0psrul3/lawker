<h1><join>Awk's Equivalent to VI's J</join></h1>
<p>A <a 
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.awk/browse_thread/thread/4af5b8ffc7bcad45/685667c8813c15b5#685667c8813c15b5">recent discussion</a>
in comp.lang.awk demonstrated a very cute, and very succinct, awk trick.
<p>Neil Harris wanted to clean up this output:
<pre>
host1name.com 
10.10.10.1 
host2name.com 
10.10.10.2 
host3name.com 
10.10.10.3 
</pre>
<p>
He was using an uppercase J in vi to manually move the hostname's 
IP address up onto the same line as it's hostname. 
But he wanted to automate the task with awk.
<p>Kenny McCormack offered:
<pre>
ORS=NR%2?" ":"\n" 
</pre>  	
<p>
(Yes, that is the whole program.)
<p>
Ed Morton offered a more elegant version:
<pre>
ORS=NR%2?FS:RS 
</pre>
<p>
Finally, Kenny McCormack commented:
<em><ul>
<li>
I'm 98% sure that I personally invented the basic idea (ORS=... as the 
pattern, with no action - i.e., default action).  
<li>Ed's enhancement was 
using FS and RS instead of hardcoding space and newline.  It's nice for 
two reasons: 
<ol>
<li>
   Saves a few golf strokes 
   <li> Is more "portable" (or "logical", if you look at it that way) in 
        that if FS and RS had been assigned non-default values, they 
        would be used. 
</ol>
<li>
Also, as he says, it is a very instructive 14 characters of AWK code. 
</ul></em>
