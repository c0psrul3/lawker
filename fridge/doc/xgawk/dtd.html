<h1><join>Dealing with DTDs</join></h2>

<p><em>(This page comes from the <a href="http://home.vrweb.de/~juergen.kahrs/gawk/XML/xmlgawk.html">XML Gawk</a> tutorial.)</em>
<p>The declaration of a document
type in the header of an XML file is an optional part of the data,
not a mandatory one. If such a declaration is present,
the reference to the DTD will not be
resolved and its contents will not be parsed. However, the presence
of the declaration will be reported by <tt>gawk</tt>. When the declaration
starts, the variable <tt>XMLSTARTDOCT</tt> contains the name of the
root element's tag; and later, when the declaration ends, the variable

<tt>XMLENDDOCT</tt> is set to 1. In between, the array variable <tt>XMLATTR</tt>
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_007d-76"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_005b_0022VERSION_0022_005d_007d-77"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_005b_0022ENCODING_0022_005d_007d-78"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_005b_0022STANDALONE_0022_005d_007d-79"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_005b_0022PUBLIC_0022_005d_007d-80"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_005b_0022SYSTEM_0022_005d_007d-81"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_005b_0022INTERNAL_005fSUBSET_0022_005d_007d-82"></a>will be populated with the values of the public identifier
of the DTD (if any) and the value of the system's identifier of the DTD
(if any). Other parts of the declaration (elements, attributes and entities)
will not be reported.

<pre>     @load xml
     XMLDECLARATION {
       version    = XMLATTR["VERSION"        ]
       encoding   = XMLATTR["ENCODING"       ]
       standalone = XMLATTR["STANDALONE"     ]
     }
     XMLSTARTDOCT {
       root       = XMLSTARTDOCT
       pub_id     = XMLATTR["PUBLIC"         ]
       sys_id     = XMLATTR["SYSTEM"         ]
       intsubset  = XMLATTR["INTERNAL_SUBSET"]
     }
     XMLENDDOCT {
       print FILENAME
       print "  version    '" version    "'"
       print "  encoding   '" encoding   "'"
       print "  standalone '" standalone "'"
       print "  root   id '" root   "'"
       print "  public id '" pub_id "'"
       print "  system id '" sys_id "'"
       print "  intsubset '" intsubset "'"
       print ""
       version = encoding = standalone = ""
       root = pub_id = sys_id = intsubset ""
     }
</pre>

   <p>Most users can safely ignore these variables if they are only
interested in the data itself. But some users may take advantage
of these variables for checking requirements of the XML data. 
If your data base consists of thousands of XML file of diverse
origins, the public identifier of their DTDs will help you gain
an oversight over the kind of data you have to handle and over
potential version conflicts. The script shown above
will assist you in analyzing your data files. It searches for the
variables mentioned above and evaluates their content. At the
start of the DTD, the tag name of the root element is stored; the
identifiers are also stored and finally, those values are printed
along with the name of the file which was analyzed. After each DTD,
the remembered values are set to an empty string until the DTD of
the next file arrives.

   <p>In the following, you can see an example output of
the script shown above. Obviously, the first
entry is a DocBook file (English version 4.2) containing a
<tt>book</tt> element which has to be validated against a local
copy of the DTD at CERN in Switzerland. The second file is a

<tt>chapter</tt> element of DocBook (English version 4.1.2) to
be validated against a DTD on the Internet. Finally, the third
entry is a file describing a project of the GanttProject application. 
There is only a tag name for the root element specified, a DTD
does not seem to exist.

   <p>You may wish to make changes to this script if you need it in
daily work. For example, the script currently reports nothing
for files which have no DTD declaration in them. You can easily
change this by appending an action for the <tt>END</tt> rule which
reports in case all the variables <tt>root</tt>, <tt>pub_id</tt>
and <tt>sys_id</tt> are empty. As it is, the script parses the
entire XML file, although the DTD is always positioned at the
top, before the root element. Parsing the root element is
unnecessary and you can improve the speed of the script significantly
if you tell it to stop parsing when the first element (the root
element) comes in.
