<p>When working with XML files, it is sometimes necessary
to gain some oversight over the structure an XML file. 
Ordinary editors confront us with a view that is not-so-pretty.
For example:
<pre class="example">     
     &lt;book id="hello-world" lang="en"&gt;
     
     &lt;bookinfo&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Hello, world&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;/bookinfo&gt;

     
     &lt;chapter id="introduction"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;
     
     &lt;para&gt;This is the introduction. It has two sections&lt;/para&gt;
     
     &lt;sect1 id="about-this-book"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;About this book&lt;/title&gt;

     
     &lt;para&gt;This is my first DocBook file.&lt;/para&gt;
     
     &lt;/sect1&gt;
     
     &lt;sect1 id="work-in-progress"&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Warning&lt;/title&gt;
     
     &lt;para&gt;This is still under construction.&lt;/para&gt;

     
     &lt;/sect1&gt;
     
     &lt;/chapter&gt;
     &lt;/book&gt;
</pre>
<p>Software developers
are used to reading text files with proper indentation
like this:
<pre class="example">     book lang='en' id='hello-world'
       bookinfo
         title
       chapter id='introduction'
         title
         para
         sect1 id='about-this-book'
           title
           para
         sect1 id='work-in-progress'
           title
           para
</pre>
   <p>Here, it is a bit
harder to recognize hierarchical dependencies among the
nodes. But proper indentation allows you to oversee files
with more than 100 elements (a purely graphical view of
such large files gets unbearable). 
<p>
The <code>outline</code> tool produces such an indented output
and we will now write a script that imitates this kind
of output. 
<pre class="example">     @load xml
     XMLSTARTELEM {
       printf("%*s%s", 2*XMLDEPTH-2, "", XMLSTARTELEM)
       for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++)
         printf(" %s='%s'", $i, XMLATTR[$i])
       print ""
     }
</pre>
<p>For the first time, we don't
just check if the <code>XMLSTARTELEM</code> variable contains
a tag name, but we also print the name out, properly indented
with a <code>printf</code> format statement (two blank characters
for each indentation level).
   <p>Note the use of the
associative
array <code>XMLATTR</code>. Whenever we enter a markup block
(and <code>XMLSTARTELEM</code> is non-empty), the array <code>XMLATTR</code>
contains all the attributes of the tag. You can find out the
value of an attribute by accessing the array with the attribute's
name as an array index. In a well-formed XML file, all the attribute
names of one tag are distinct, so we can be sure that each attribute
has its own place in the array. The only thing that's left to do is
to iterate over all the entries in the array and print name and value
in a formatted way. Earlier versions of this script really iterated
over the associative array with the <samp><span class="command">for (i in XMLATTR)</span></samp>
loop. Doing so is still an option, but in this case we wanted to
make sure that attributes are printed in exactly the same oder
that is given in the original XML data. The exact order of attribute
names is reproduced in the fields <code>$1 .. $NF</code>. So the
<code>for</code> loop can iterate over the attributes <em>names</em> in the
fields <code>$1 .. $NF</code> and print the attribute <em>values</em>
<code>XMLATTR[$i]</code>.
