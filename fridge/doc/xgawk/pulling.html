<h1><join> Pulling data from an XML file </join></h1>
<p><em>(This page comes from the <a href="http://home.vrweb.de/~juergen.kahrs/gawk/XML/xmlgawk.html">XML Gawk</a> tutorial.)</em>


<p>
In
a procedural language, the software developer expects that he
himself determines control flow within a program. He writes
down what has to be done first, second, third and so on. 
In the <em>pattern-action</em> model of AWK, the novice software
developer often has the oppressive feeling that
     <ul>
<li>she is not <em>in control</em>

<li>events seem to crackle down on her from nowhere
<li>data flow seems chaotic and invariants don't exist
<li>assertions seem impossible
</ul>

   <p>This feeling is characteristic for a whole class of
programming environments. Most people would never think
of the following programming environments to have something
in common, but they have. It is the absence of a static
control flow which unites these environments under one roof:

     <ul>
<li>In GUI frameworks like the X Window system, the main program
is a trivial <em>event loop</em> &ndash; the main program does
nothing but wait for events and invoke event-handlers. 
<li>In the Prolog programming language, the main program
has the form of a <em>query</em> &ndash; and then the Prolog
interpreter decides which rules to apply to solve the
query. 

<li>When writing a compiler with the <code>lex</code> and <code>yacc</code>
tools, the main program only invokes a function <code>yyparse()</code>
and the exact control flow depends on the input source which
controls invocation of certain rules. 
<li></a>When writing an XML parser with the
<a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net">Expat</a> XML parser,
the main program registers some callback handler functions,
passes the XML source to the Expat parser and the detailed
invocation of callback function depends on the XML source. 
<li>Finally, AWK's <em>pattern-action</em> encourages writing
scripts that have no main program at all. 

</ul>

   <p>Within the context of XML, a terminology has been invented
which distinguishes the procedural <em>pull</em> style from
the event-guided <em>push</em> style. The script in the previous
section was an example of a <em>push</em>-style script. 
Recognizing that most developers don't like their program's
control flow to be pushed around, we will now present a script
which pulls one item after the other from the XML file and
decides what to do next in a more obvious way.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bXMLATTR_007d-54"></a>
<pre class="example">     @load xml
     BEGIN {
       while (getline &gt; 0) {
         switch (XMLEVENT) {
           case "STARTELEM": {
             printf("%*s%s", 2*XMLDEPTH-2, "", XMLSTARTELEM)
             for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++)
               printf(" %s='%s'", $i, XMLATTR[$i])
             print ""
           }
         }
       }
     }

</pre>
   <p>One XML event after the other is pulled out of the data
with the <samp><span class="command">getline</span></samp> command. It's like feeling each grain
of sand pour through your fingers. Users who prefer this style
of reading input will also appreciate another novelty: The variable
<code>XMLEVENT</code>.  While the <em>push-style</em> script in
<a href="http://awk.info/?xgawk/outline">another page</a> used the event-specific variable
<samp><span class="command">XMLSTARTELEM</span></samp> to detect the occurrence of a new XML element,
our <em>pull-style</em> script always looks at the value of the same
universal variable <code>XMLEVENT</code> to detect a new XML element. 

   <p>Formally, we have a script that consists of one <code>BEGIN</code>

pattern followed by an action which is always invoked. You
see, this is a corner case of the <em>pattern-action</em> model
which has been reduced so wide that its essence has disappeared. 
Instead of the patterns you now see the cases of <samp><span class="command">switch</span></samp>
statement, embedded into a <code>while</code> loop (for reading the
file item-wise). 
Obviously, we have explicite conditionals now, instead of the
implicite ones we used formerly. The actions invoked within
the <code>case</code> conditions are the same we have seen in the
<em>push</em> approach.
