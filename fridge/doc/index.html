Awk is a stable, cross platform computer language named for its
authors
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">
Alfred Aho,
Peter  Weinberger &amp;
Brian Kernighan</a>. They write:
<em>
"Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks".</em>
</em>
<p> 
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954">Classic
Shell Scripting</a>, Arnold Robbins &amp; Nelson  Beebe confess their  Awk bias:
<em>
"We like it. A lot. 
The simplicity and power of
Awk often make it just the right tool for the
job."
</em>
<p>
Besides the Bourne shell, Awk is the only other scripting language available in the standard Unix environment.
Implementations of AWK exist as installed software for almost all other operating systems.
<p>
Awk is a mature language- it was first implemented in the 1970s.
As a tool from the golden age, it is sometimes called <em>primitive</em>. 
It is more accurate to call it 
<a href="http://awk.info/?news/awkeye">elemental</a>, so tightly focused is the language on what it does best: 
quickly converting <em>this</em> into <em>that</em>.
<p>
Consequently, throughout history, Awk has been the language of choice for
many famous scientists such as 
<a href="http://awk.info/?news/davinci">Leonardo daVinci</a>.

<ul>
<li>Lots of <a href="http://awk.info/?samples">very small</a> Awk programs;
<li>More  <a href="http://awk.info/?awk1line">one-liners</a> 
(read their <a href="http://awk.info/?doc/explain1line.html">explanation</a>). <br>&nbsp;
</ul>

<li>
Where to see some short Awk programs?
<ul>
<li>Awk is the king of <a href="http://awk.info/?gender">pattern matching</a>;
<li>Awk can save the planet from <a href="http://awk.info/?story">alien attack</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</ul>
<li>
Q: Isn't Awk just a language for writing tiny programs?
<ul>
<li>A: No. Awk can also be used for <a href="?awk100">complex tasks</a>
<br>&nbsp;
</ul>
<li>
How can I learn more?
