<hr><h2>What is Awk?</h2>
<p> 
Awk is a stable, cross platform computer language named for its
authors
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">
Alfred Aho,
  Peter  Weinberger &amp;
  Brian Kernighan</a>. They write:
<ul><em><p>
"Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
  applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks".</em>
</em></ul>
<p> 
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954">Classic
Shell Scripting</a>, Arnold Robbins &amp; Nelson  Beebe confess their  Awk bias:
<ul>
<em>
<p>"We like it. A lot. 
<p>
"The simplicity and power of
Awk often make it just the right tool for the
job.
<p>
"When we have on occasion rewritten an Awk program in a conventional
programming language like C or C++, the result was usually much
longer, and much harder to debug."
</em>
</ul>
<p>
Throughout history, Awk has been the langauge of choice for
many famous scientists. 
For example,
Leonardo daVinci coded in Awk:
