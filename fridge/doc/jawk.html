<h2>Description</h2>
<strong>Jawk</strong>
 parses, analyzes, and interprets and/or compiles
AWK scripts.  Compilation is targetted for the JVM.
<p>
<strong>Jawk</strong>
 runs on any platform which supports, at minimum,
J2SE 5.

<h2>Usage</h2>

To use, simply download the application, copy the release jar to the
jawk.jar file and execute the following command:
<pre>
java -jar jawk.jar <em>{command-line-arguments}</em>
</pre>
<p>
To view the command line argument usage summary, execute
<pre>
java -jar jawk.jar -h
</pre>
The output of this command is shown below:

<small><pre>

-ext= (extension) Enable user-defined extensions. (default: not enabled)
-ni = (extension) Do NOT process stdin or ARGC/V through input rules.
                  (Useful for blocking extensions.)
                  (Note: -ext &amp; -ni available only in interpreted mode.)

 -h or -? = (extension) This help screen.

<h2>Extensions</h2>
Jawk addresses a drawback with standard Awk.
For example, in standard Awk, it us be impossible to create a socket or display a simple GUI without external assistance either from the shell or via extensions to Awk itself (i.e., gawk). To overcome this limitation, an extension facility is added to Jawk .
<p>
The Jawk extension facility allows for arbitrary Java code to be called as Awk functions in a Jawk script. These extensions can come from the user (developer) or 3rd party providers (i.e., the Jawk project team). And, Jawk extensions are opt-in. In other words, the -ext flag is required to use Jawk extensions and extensions must be explicitly registered to the Jawk instance via the -Djawk.extensions property (except for core extensions bundled with Jawk ).
<p>
Also, Jawk extensions support blocking. You can think of blocking as a tool for extension event management. A Jawk script can block on a collection of blockable services, such as socket input availability, database triggers, user input, GUI dialog input response, or a simple fixed timeout, and, together with the -ni option, action rules can act on block events instead of input text, leveraging a powerful AWK construct originally intended for text processing, but now can be used to process blockable events. A sample enhanced echo server script is included in this article. It uses blocking to handle socket events, standard input from the user, and timeout events, all within the 47-line script (including comments). 
<h2>Example</h2>

The example script implements a simple echo server which also allows broadcast
messaging via stdin input from the server process:

<small><pre>
<strong><em>## to run: java ... -jar jawk.jar -ext -ni -f {filename}</em></strong>
BEGIN {
	css = CServerSocket(7777);
	print "(echo server socket created)"
}
<strong><em>## note: default input processing disabled by -ni</em></strong>
$0 = SocketAcceptBlock(css,
	SocketInputBlock(sockets,
		SocketCloseBlock(css, sockets,
			StdinBlock(
				Timeout(1000)))));
				<strong><em>## note: default action { print } disabled by -ni</em></strong>
<strong><em># $1 = "SocketAccept", $2 = socket handle</em></strong>
$1 == "SocketAccept" {
	socket = SocketAccept($2)
	sockets[socket] = 1
}

<strong><em># $1 = "SocketInput", $2 = socket handle</em></strong>
$1 == "SocketInput" {
	<strong><em>## echo server action:</em></strong>

	socket = $2
	line = SocketRead(socket)
	SocketWrite(socket, line)
}

<strong><em># $1 = "SocketClose", $2 = socket handle</em></strong>
$1 == "SocketClose" {
	socket = $2
	SocketClose(socket)
	delete sockets[socket]
}
<strong><em>## display a . for every second the server is running</em></strong>
$0 == "Timeout" {
	printf "."
}
<strong><em>## stdin block is last because StdinGetline writes directly to $0</em></strong>
<strong><em>## $0 == "Stdin"</em></strong>
$0 == "Stdin" {
	<strong><em>## broadcast message to all sockets</em></strong>
	retcode = StdinGetline()
	if (retcode != 1)
		exit
	for (socket in sockets)
		SocketWrite(socket, "From server : " $0)
	print "(message sent)"
}

</pre>
</small>
<p>
Each extension function used in the script above is covered in
some detail below:
<ul>
<li><strong>CServerSocket</strong> - Creates a <em>character-based</em> server socket.
SocketRead for character-based sockets return lines of text (with
newlines stripped), while SocketRead returns blocks of bytes
(converted to a String) for sockets accepted by ServerSocket.
Use character-based sockets for interactive or line-based input,
and use ordinary sockets to achieve high-throughput since arbitrary
byte blocks are returned.
To create a client socket, use CSocket for character-based sockets,
or Socket for byte-block-based sockets.
<li><strong>SocketAcceptBlock/SocketInputBlock/SocketCloseBlock/StdinBlock/Timeout</strong> -
Each of these extensions is a <strong>blocking</strong> extension,
blocking for particular events, such as a server socket is ready
to accept an incoming socket, or a connected socket has input to
be read, or a certain amount of time has elapsed, etc.
Socket*Block extension functions come from SocketExtension,
StdinBlock comes from StdinExtension, and Timeout comes from CoreExtension.
Each Socket*Block extension returns a string of the format:
<pre>
<em>extension-label-prefix</em> <strong>OFS</strong> <em>parameter</em>
</pre>
while StdinBlock and Timeout returns
<pre>
<em>extension-label-prefix</em>
</pre>
<li><strong>SocketAccept/SocketRead/SocketWrite/SocketClose</strong> -
Socket operations, as the names of the extension functions suggest.
Each will block until it is able to complete the operation.
<li><strong>StdinGetline</strong> - Get a line of input from stdin.  If there is no
stdin, block until input is available.  This is why blocking is
a valuable tool.  This way, the script can wait for other events
while waiting for stdin, bringing AWK out of the focused text
processing domain into a powerful event processing language.

</ul>
<p>As stated by the comments, <code><strong>-ni</strong></code> disables stdin processing (as provided
by Jawk
 itself, not the StdinExtension) and the default blank rule of
<code> { print } </code>.  Disabling stdin processing is paramount to extension
processing because, otherwise,
it would be confusing, if not completely impossible, to multiplex
extension blocking with Jawk
's default stdin processing.  And, disabling
the default blank rule allows for easy-to-read blocking statements
(like the one provided in the sample script) without the wierd side
effect of printing the result.
