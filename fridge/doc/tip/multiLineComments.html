What did you have in mind?

       print "hi" # here is a comment \
               that continues on the next line \
                without a # sign
</pre>
<p>(Editor's note: 
if this tip is combined with 
<a href="http://awk.info/?dsl/markdown">Markdown</a> syntax for comments,
it would be possible to do a kind of literare programming in Awk,
have the comments human readable in their raw form, and also
be able to generate pretty HTML pages straight from the code.)
