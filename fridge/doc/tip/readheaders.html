<h1><join>Using Field Names to Reference Columns</join></h1>

<p>
<em>In comp.lang.awk, Janis Papanagnou  comments on how Awk can read a CSV files where the headers are named in line one.</em>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a a csv file with headers for field names.
Gawk can use those headers for field names- which makes the code more
intuitive and easier to work with. Given that awk is
expected to work on tabular data, this seems to be a good alternative
to just field numbers.
<h2>Solution</h2>
Try this shell script:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
awk -F, -v cols="${1:?}" '
   BEGIN {
     n=split(cols,col)
     for (i=1; i<=n; i++) s[col[i]]=i
   }
   NR==1 {
     for (f=1; f&lt;=NF; f++)
       if ($f in s) c[s[$f]]=f
     next
   }
   { sep=""
     for (f=1; f&lt;=n; f++) {
       printf("%c%s",sep,$c[f])
       sep=FS
     }
     print ""
   }
'
</pre>
<p>
This script can be  called  with an arbitrary list of column names
as defined in the first line of your data file and separated by
the same field separator as your data.
<p>
For example, suppose the above code is in <em>bycolname.sh</em>
and we have data that looks like this:
<pre>
hello,world,region_name,foo,bar,xyz,dummy
11111,22222,aspac,77777,8888888,xyz,zzzzz
21111,22222,ASPAC,77777,8888888,xyz,zzzzz
31111,22222,ASPAC,77777,8888888,XYZ,zzzzz
41111,22222,aspac,77777,8888888,XYZ,zzzzz
</pre>
<p>
Now, calling this command... 
<pre>
sh bycolname.sh world,hello
</pre>
... would produce:
<pre>
22222,11111
22222,21111
22222,31111
22222,41111
</pre>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>
Non existing column names will expand to $0 each, which may
be surprising if there's an unnoticed typo in your field list.
