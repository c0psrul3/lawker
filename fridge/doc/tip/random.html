<h1><join>Random Numbers in Gawk</join></h1>

<p><em>(Summarized and extended from a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.awk/browse_thread/thread/a5af2e65bd179961#">recent discussion at comp.lang.awk</a>.)</em><p>

<h2>Background </h2>

<p>A standard idiom in Gawk is to reset the random number generator in a BEGIN block.
<pre>
BEGIN {srand() }
</pre>
<p>Sadly,  when called with no arguments, this "reseeding" uses time-in-seconds. So if the same "random"
task runs multiple times in the same second, it will get the same random number seed.

I have a Gawk script that puts random comments into a file. It is run 3
times in a row in quick succession. I found that seeding the random
number generator using gawk did not work because all 3 times it was run
was done within the same second (and it uses the time). 

<p>I was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions as to
 what can be done to get around this
problem.

<h2>Solution #1: Persistent Memory</h2>
		
<p><b>Kenny McCormack  writes:</b>

When last I ran into this problem, what I did was to save the last value
returned by rand() to a file, then on the next run, read that in and use
that value as the arg to srand().  Worked well.
	
	
<p><em>(Editor's comment: Kenny's solution does work well but incurs the cost of maintaining and reading/writing that
"last value"   file.)</em></p>

<h2>Solution #2: Use Bash</h2>

<p><b>Tim Menzies writes:</b>

<p>How about setting the seed using the BASH $RANDOM variable:
<pre>
gawk -v Seed=$RANDOM --source 'BEGIN { srand(Seed ? Seed : 1) }' 
</pre>
<p>If referenced multiple times in a second, it always generates
a different number. 

<p>In the above usage, if we have a seed, use it. Else, no seed so start all "random"  at the same place. If you prefer to
use the default "seed from time-in-seconds" then use:
<pre>
BEGIN { if (Seed) { srand(Seed) } else { srand() } }
</pre>

<p><em>(Editor's comment: Tim's solution incurs the overhead of additional command-line syntax. However, it does allow
the process calling Gawk to control the seed. This is important when trying to, say, debug code by recreating the sequence
of random numbers that lead to the bug.)</em>

<h2>Solution #3: Query the OS</h2>

<p><b>Thomas Weidenfeller writes:</b>

<p>Is that good enough (random enough) for your task?
<pre>
BEGIN {
        "od -tu4 -N4 -A n /dev/random" | getline
        srand(0+$0)
}
</pre>


<p><em>(Editor's comment: Nice. Thomas' solution reminds us that "Gawk" can access a whole host of operating system 
facilities.)</em>

<h2>Solution #4: Use the Process Id</h2>

<p><b>Aharon Robbins   	writes:</b>

<p>You could so something like add PROCINFO["pid"] to the value of the time,
or use that as the seed.
<pre>
$ gawk 'BEGIN { srand(systime() + PROCINFO["pid"]); print rand() }'
0.405889
$ gawk 'BEGIN { srand(systime() + PROCINFO["pid"]); print rand() }'
0.671906
</pre>

<p><em>(Editor's comment: Aharon's solution is the fastest of all the ones shown here. For example, on Mac OS/X, his
solution takes 6ms to run:</em>
<pre>
$ time gawk 'BEGIN { srand(systime() + PROCINFO["pid"]) }'

real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.004s
</pre>
<p><em>while Thomas' solution is somewhat  slower:</em>
<pre>
$ time gawk 'BEGIN { "od -tu4 -N4 -A n /dev/random" | getline; srand($0+0) }'

real    0m0.039s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.034s
</pre>
<p><em>Note that while Aharon's solution is the fastest, it does not let some master process set the seed for the Gawk process (e.g. as in Tim's approach).</em>)
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you want raw speed, use Aharon's approach. 
<p>If you want seed control, see Tim's approach.
