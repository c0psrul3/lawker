<em>I just started with awk and sed, I am more of a perl/C/C++ person.  I
have a quick question reguarding the pipe.  In Awk, I am trying to use this
construct.</em>
<pre>
while ((getline < "somedata.txt") > 0)
            {print | "mv"} #or could be "mv -v" for verbose.

<em>Is it possible that "print" is no longer printing the value of
getline, if so how do I correct it?

<p><b>Arnold Robbins</b> comments:
<p>The problem here is that `mv' doesn't read standard input, it only
processes command lines.  Assuming that your data is something like:
<pre>
oldfile newfile
</pre>
<p>
You can do things two ways:
<pre>
# build the command and execute it
while ((getline &lt; "somedata.txt") > 0) {
          command = "mv " $1 " " $2
          system(command)
}
close("somedata.txt")
</pre>
<p>
or this way:
<pre>
# send commands to the shell
while ((getline &lt; "somedata.txt") > 0) {
          printf("mv %s %s\n", $1, $2) | "sh"
}
close("somedata.txt")
close("sh")
</pre>
<p>
The latter is more efficient.
