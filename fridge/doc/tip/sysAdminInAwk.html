<p>The nice thing about humans is that they're at least somewhat predictable. Given the choice between having data randomly strewn about, and having it in some predictable pattern, humans will generally choose predictable patterns (Microsoft filesystem management issues notwithstanding). These patterns are what make awk, a pattern-matching programming language, a wonderful tool for systems administrators, database administrators, and even command-line junkies who use their box mainly for pleasure. The notion of being able to write a one-line command to do almost anything draws ever closer with awk in your tool belt.
For most things administrators use awk for, it's an extremely simple language. As you get into writing more advanced awk scripts, at some point it becomes a bit cumbersome, and you realize that Perl is also your friend. But for now, let's focus on how awk can get you the most bang for your keyboard strokes, shall we?
<p>
The first thing you should know is that awk is actually a rather powerful language. Entire books have been written about its use. If you're so inclined, you can write extremely complex 1000-line scripts using awk. However, as a systems administrator (the intended audience for this article), 99% of your use of awk will consist of relatively short scripts, and one-off one-liners typed right on the command line. Here's an example of a common use of awk:
<pre>
[jonesy@newhotness jonesy]$ cat access_log | 
     awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
</pre>
<p>
The above one-liner uses awk to slim down the amount of data coming from the web server's access log. The access log is space-delimited, and I only want to see the first field (hence "print $1"). Once I have that data, I want to sort it, then I have "uniq -c" provide a count of each occurrence for each unique value, and then I produce a reverse sort based on the numeric count provided by "uniq". The result has the number of hits in the left column, and the host in the right column, and the most frequent visitors are at the top of the list. Give it a shot! Even if you're hosted by an ISP, you should be able to access this log.
<p>
Awk is perfect for ripping data into smaller chunks, to make it more bite-size for other applications or manipulation. To use it on the command line on files that are not space-delimited, you can use the "-F" flag, and indicate a delimiter. This is useful for tearing apart /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. For example:

<pre>
[jonesy@tux jonesy]$ cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $5}' | awk -F, '{print NF}'
</pre>
<p>
I actually used something kinda similar to that during a NIS to LDAP migration to see if the gecos field ($5 in /etc/passwd) had consistent enough data to be useful. One of the tests is to see how consistent the number of datapoints held in the gecos field is from record to record. To figure out the number of fields in each record's gecos field, I tell awk to use ":" as the delimiter, and, based on that, print the fifth field. I then pipe that to another awk one-liner, which uses an awk built-in variable, "NF" and a different delimiter (gecos is generally comma-delimited, if it's even used for useful data).

<h2>Awk in Scripts</h2>
<p>
When one-liners just aren't enough for you, you can store a whole bunch of awk one-liners in a file, and call awk with "-f script" to tell it which file to read its commands from. Additionally, since awk needs to act on some data, you should also tag on something to take care of feeding awk the data it so desperately needs. For example, if I have a script called "getuname", which looks like this:

<pre>
BEGIN { FS=":" }
      {print $1}
</pre>
<p>
I can now call that script, feeding it anything that I know ahead of time has the user name as the first field in a given record. So I can say "awk -f getuname < /etc/passwd", or "ypcat passwd | awk -f getuname". There are two rather important things I did in this script that will save you some headaches. First, notice the "BEGIN" statement. This statement exists to give you some space to do some tasks before awk starts reading any data. In this example, I want awk to know before it processes any data, that it should use a colon as its field separator. Sure, I could've called awk differently to get around this, ie "awk -F: -f getuname < /etc/passwd", but this way is shorter, and that's the point! It should also be noted that, if you have the need, you can also have an "END" section to your script, which will perform any actions, once, after the last data record has been processed.
<p>
On the second line, I've just called a simple awk "action" statement, just like on the command line, with one important exception: I didn't use single quotes around it. If I had, the shell would've tried to interpret this part of the script and choked. I know, because it happened while I was testing this script. Bad admin!

<h2>Built-in Goodness</h2>
<p>

Awk has some built-in functions, like most scripting languages, which make life a bit easier. It also has some built-in variables that awk keeps track of for you -- and you get their values for free, just for asking, which is nice. The most useful variable I've had the pleasure to use as an admin is the "NF" variable, which will tell you, based on the field separator given (space by default), how many fields are in the current record. Conversely, the most useful function I've used as an awk scripter is the "split" function, which can break a single field into another array of separate fields. First, here's a quick example of NF in action:

<pre>
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print NF}'
</pre>
<p>
This is the lazy man's way to get the users' shells from the /etc/passwd file without having to remember how many fields are in the file. But wait! This doesn't print the last field in the record! It prints the number of fields in the record! Simple enough -- add a "$" to the front of "NF", and you'll get what you're looking for. Pipe the output to a couple of "sort" and "uniq" commands like we did earlier with the web log, and you'll get a snapshot of what the most commonly used shells are.
<p>
Now let's have a look at the split function. Let's say you use your gecos field to store a bunch of datapoints, and the datapoints within the gecos field are comma-delimited. This is not nearly so contrived as it might sound -- this happens in more than two environments I've done work in. Here's what it might look like:

<pre>
jonesy:x:12000:13:Brian K. Jones,LUSER,101B,NONE:/home/jonesy:/bin/bash
</pre>
<p>
Now let's say your PHB comes along and says he's tired of referring to me as "jonesy" and wants to know my real name. You can use awk's "split" function to help you here, and the code for doing so is fairly short:
<pre>
BEGIN { FS=":" }
      {
        gfields = split ( $5, gecos, ",")
        chunkname = split ( gecos[1], fullname, " " )
        print fullname[chunkname], fullname[1]
      }
</pre>
<p>
Let's translate that into English, shall we? Of course, you now know what the BEGIN statement does here -- nothing new. We'll start by looking at the "gfields" line, where I use "split" to break up the 5th field of the record, (the gecos field), using the comma as a delimiter, and storing all of the resulting fields in an array called "gecos". This can be counterintuitive, as you may be tempted to think that the resulting array is called "gfields". However, the "gfields" variable actually represents the last field in the record. You get a look at how this works in the following two lines. "chunkname" represents the number of fields in the "fullname" array. The "fullname" array is created by splitting the first field of the "gecos" array (in this case, the field holding my full name), using a space as the delimiter. On the next line, I reference "fullname[chunkname]", which will print the last name of the person, even if (as in my case) they have a middle name or initial. Then I print the very first field in the fullname array, so the output generated by this script acting on my passwd record would be "Jones Brian".
<h2>
In conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Whew! That was a mouthful. Awk has so many cool little hacks and
built-in features that there has been more than one book published
just on Awk. Undoubtedly, I'll utilize some of these features in
future articles that involve putting together syadmin solutions
using various scripts as duct tape.
