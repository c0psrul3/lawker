<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This paper describes an easy-to-use set of tools which enables 
moderately to well experienced TEX-users to produce formatted 
output from flat data files. Usually all you need is AWK, TEX, and a sort program. 
<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<p>
Let us assume we have a text file containing 
addresses in more or less random order. Let us 
further assume that the main purpose of the file is to 
produce a printed address list and directory, possible 
in different versions sorted according to different 
criteria. Let us further assume that the data file 
has a very simple structure, namely a number of 
lines for each address and different addresses being 
separated by blank lines. Additionally, we assume 
that the items to be used in sorting occur on the 
same line in every address block, e.g. the surname 
is always on the first line, the city on the third line, 
and so on. 
<p>
Now we would like to format this material into 
a two-column format for an address book to be 
typeset by TEX.  
For the first step, let us assume 
that the data already are sorted in the sequence we 
need for the printed version. Then the following 
little AWK program does the trick: 
<pre>
BEGIN { 
	RS="" 
	FS="\n" 
	printf "\\documentstyle [twocolumn] " 
	printf "{article)\nl' 
	printf "\\begin{document)\n\n" 
} 
  { for(i=l;i<=NF-l;i++) 
   	     printf "%s \\\\ \n", $i 
    printf "%s \n\nN, $NF 
}
END { 
	print "" 
	printf "\% %d records transferred \n\nl" ,NR
	print "\\end{document)" 
}
</pre>
<p>
If you keep the program in a file <em>address.awk</em> 
and execute the following command, 
<pre>
auk -f address.awk address.dat > address.tex 
</pre>
<p>
then the file <em>address.tex</em> will contain a LATEX file 
which prints the address book.
