<h1><join>Linking Awk to Spreadsheets</join></h1>
<P>Axel Renihold's 
<a href="http://www.freakout.de/mc.htm#Contents">MacroCALC</a> (mc) interactive spreadhsheet calculator 
is an interactive, macro-programmable tool. mc has no graphic features, but therefore it can run also on terminals. It uses a convenient, well-known user interface and has some special features especially interesting in the UNIX environment.
<p>
mc has an elaborate operating 
system via piping. 
That is, mc and Unix tools like Awk can be easily intergrated.
<p>
A "cell" statement has the syntax:
<pre>
cell &lt; command
</pre>
(and "command" is any Unix script, e.g. using Awk).  When such a
cell is entered, it will:
<ul>
<Li> execute the command
<li>put the command's output into the range
of cells starting with cell as the upper-left corner.
</ul> 
<p>The output
 is read line by line into the rows of the range. The columns, which
 have to be separated by "tab" in the output of the command, are
 placed into the columns of the range. 
<p>
At the end of the data a
special cell value designated 'EOF' (end of file) is placed in the
cell below the data.
This offers great flexibility based upon the Unix operating
system's piping mechanism
