<a name=2></a><h2> Usage</h2>
<P>
    In general, specify the state machine in FILE.fsm and define the
    action functions in FILE_actions.c. Then run 
	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsa.awk">fsa.awk</a>
    compile and link 
	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsa.c">fsa.c</a>
	fsm_FILE.c and any driver file. Thats it.
<P>
    Multiple fsms may be built and run in the same application using the
    function fsm_allocFsm().  Moreover, calls to fsm() may be nested
    using the same state machine as long as a different context is used.
    fsm_allocFsm() returns a context number that must be stored and passed
    to fsm() on each invoction.  In the provided sample, the context is
    stored in myContext in test_driver.c.
<P>
    Fsm() may be called either by polling for events or from inside an
    interrupt service routine.  If fsm() is called from an interrupt
    service routine, it must be protected from nested calls using the
    same context.  Interrupting calls using other contexts is permitted.
<P>
    Note that the function fsminit() is called only once and should not
    be called for each fsm.  If there are special requirements for a
    given fsm, an appropriate init function should be provided and
    called for that particular fsm.
<P>
    Currently, fsm traceEnable is set to true and cannot be disbled
    (without changing fsm_allocFsm()).  An array is maintained within
    each fsm context wherein each state and event are recorded for each
    call to fsm().

<a name=3></a><H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
    Fsm.awk is an awk script designed to read a finite state machine (fsm)
    specification and produce C files which implement that fsm.  The file 
    <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.c">fsm.c</a>, 
	included in the distribution, provides the actual state transition
    function, and the user provides the state transition "action" functions
    and any special initialization.
<P>
    The fsm distribution consists mainly of 
	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.awk">fsm.awk</a> and 
	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.c">fsm.c</a>, although
    there are a number of header files for declarations - doesn't get
    much simpler than that.
<P>
    Typically, the fsm specification is named in the form fsm_name.fsm, but 
    may be named any legal filename.  The action functions may be placed in
    any number of files by any name the user chooses.  Each function should
    return either true or false so that the appropriate next state may be
    chosen.
<P>
    The chief benefit of using <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.awk">fsm.awk</a> 
	is easy to read, consistent state
    machine specifications and reuse of existing, tested code.  Multiple
    tables and multiple users are happily accommodated. It's not hi-tech,
    but in provides an easy avenue to generalization and consistency where
    fsms are required.
<P>
    This distribution represents a rewrite of an earlier version written
    many years ago - rewritten with newer versions of awk and gcc in mind.
    Consequently, it has not been tested using other compiler suites.
    There are no known bugs, but, it IS a rewrite. 
<P>
    Although a good candidate for C++, C was used because C++ was not being
    used in any of the systems currently using fsm-gen.  Maybe a C++ version
    will be in a subsequent release.
<a name=4></a><H2> Building the Sample FSM</H2>
<P>
    The distribution provides the following files:
 .PRE
COPYING and      FSF licenses
COPYING.LESSER
filelist         the "packing list"
fsm.awk          the code generator
fsm.c            the context and transition code
fsm.h            definitions for the API
makefile         simple makefile for the test driver code
utils.h          error and utility definitions
test.fsm         a sample fsm specification named "test"
test_actions.c   action functions for the sample
</PRE>
<P>
To build the sample,
<OL>
<LI>
Download the
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents.zip">.zip</a>
<LI>
 extract the files from the zip - unzip contents.zip
<LI>
 build the example fsm - ./fsm.awk test.fsm
            This step will produce fsm_test.c and fsm_test.h.
<LI>
compile and link the executable (test) using make
<LI>
run the sample - the executable produced by the
            makefile is "test".  See the section <em>THE EXAMPLE FSM</em>
            below for information on using the example.
<P>
    When fsm.awk is run, (run via fsm.awk fsmName.fsm) it produces two
    files, fsm_fsmName.c and fsm_fsmName.h.  Fsm_fsmName.c will contain
    an array of struct fsm_s tagged as fsm_fsmName, eg.,
<pre>
struct fsm_s fsm_fsmName [STATES_COUNT][EVENTS_COUNT].
</pre>
<P>
    In the fsm distribution, the files fsm_test.c, fsm_test.h and
    test_actions.c may be built as an executable sample.
<P>
    The file fsm.c should be compiled and linked with the final executable 
    as it contains the C code necessary to read the generated tables and 
    update context.  
<> P</>
    Building the example should compile error free with the exception of
    a warning about using "gets()" in the sample driver.  Hey - it's just
    a driver for a test.

<a name=5></a><H2> Example FSM Specification File</H2>
<P>
    In its purist form, a fsm specifies state, event, action, new state.
    For example, a rudimentary ftp server might be specified as follows:
<PRE>
# current     event     action          next 
# state                                  state
# --------------+----------+---------------+------------
IDLE            CONN_REQ   makeConnection  CONNECTED
CONNECTED       GET_REQ    sendBuffer      SENDING
SENDING         FILE_SENT  closeFile       IDLE
</PRE>
<P>
    It is useful on occasion to make the next state depend on the success
    or failure of the action function.  Here, "ok" and "fail" mean "true"
    and "false", respectively.  For example, as each buffer is sent
    it would be useful to specify a different state if sendFile() returns
    fail (indicating EOF).
<PRE>
# current     event     action     next         next 
# state                             state        state
#                                    ok           fail
# --------------+----------+----------+---------+-----
CONNECTED       GET_REQ    sendBuffer SENDING   IDLE
</PRE>
<P>
    State, event, action, and new state may be specified according to the
    same rules as C variables/functions.  In the above table, the words
    CONNECTED, GET_REQ, SENDING, and IDLE are used to generate #defines, 
    and the action sendBuffer is the name of a user supplied function.

<P> The file test.fsm illustrates several idioms:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
         an event may be a single event or a comma separated list of 
            events that all result in the same action and same next state.
            For example, the specification
<PRE>
# current     event     action     next         next 
# state                             state        state
#                                    ok           fail
# --------------+----------+----------+---------+-----
S1              EVENT_1    action_1   S2        S3
</PRE>
<P> means, when receiving event EVENT_1 or EVENT_2 in state S1,</P>
            execute action action_1 and go to state S2 if the return value
            of action_1() is true; go to state S3 if the return value of
            action_1 is false.
<LI>
         note that all events must be specified for each state.  See the
            example specification file, test.fsm.
<LI>
         an action specified as "-" means, "do nothing".  fsm.awk will
            generate a NULL in the state transition tables which will 
            be treated as "do nothing".  When so specified, the next state
            will always be the next-state-ok state.
<LI>
         an action specified as fsm_invalid_event will call the function
            fsm_invalid_event(void) which always returns false.  This 
            function may be edited to suit the situation at hand.  When
            fsm_invalid_event is specified, the next state (both) may be 
            left unspecified - fsm.awk will generate next state information
            as being the current state (ie., no change in the current state).
<lI>
         a fail next state specified as "-" means the fail next state is 
            the same as the success next state.  That is, in the specification
<PRE>
# current     event     action     next         next 
# state                             state        state
#                                    ok           fail
# --------------+----------+----------+---------+-----
S1              EVENT_1    action_1   S2        -
</PRE>
            means, when receiving event EVENT_1 in state S1, execute action
            action_1 and go to state S2 irrespective of the return value of 
            action_1().
</UL>
<a name=6></a><H2> The Example FSM</H2>
<P>
    Included in the distribution are test.fsm and test_actions.c which
    implement a very simple state machine called "test".  After the
    executable "test" is produced (via make), it may be used to show the
    behavior of the fsm.
<P>
    The example fsm was built and tested with gcc version 4.0.2 and awk
    version 3.1.4.

<a name=7></a><h2> Example Output from the Sample</h2>
<P>
      On running "test", first the line "testing fsm test" is printed, then a
    line indicating the initial state.  It then asks for the next event.
    All events in the example are the lowercase letters 'a' thru 'd',
    entered from the keyboard. A special event 'z' will cause the trace to
    be dumped.  Entering 'q' will cause test to exit.  Note that to keep
    the example simple, other than special events 'z' and 'q', there is no
    checking of input for being outside the known set of events.  A sample
    session might look like this:
<PRE>
$>
$> ./test
testing fsm test

starting in state 1
next event: a
got a (0)  ----> called fsm_s2_ab ----> ,went to state 0
next event: d
got d (3)  ----> invalid eventwent to state 0
next event: b
got b (1)  ----> called fsm_s1_b ----> ,went to state 1
next event: c
got c (2)  ----> went to state 1
next event: z
trace index is 4
event      state
0          0
3          0
1          1
2          1
0          0 &lt;-- next/oldest
0          0
0          0
0          0

next event: q
bye
