<P>
 M1 is a  simple macro language that
 supports the essential operations of defining strings and replacing strings in text by
 their definitions. It also provides facilities for file inclusion and for conditional expan-
 sion of text. It is not designed for any particular application, so it is mildly useful
 across several applications, including document preparation and programming. This
 paper describes the evolution of the program; the final version is implemented in about
 110 lines of Awk.
<P>
 M1 copies its input file(s) to its output unchanged except as modified by
 certain "macro expressions."  The following lines define macros for
 subsequent processing:
<PRE>
 @comment Any text
 @@                     same as @comment
 @define name value
 @default name value    set if name undefined
 @include filename
 @if varname            include subsequent text if varname != 0
 @unless varname        include subsequent text if varname == 0
 @fi                    terminate @if or @unless
 @ignore DELIM          ignore input until line that begins with DELIM
 @stderr stuff          send diagnostics to standard error
</PRE>
<P>
 A definition may extend across many lines by ending each line with
 a backslash, thus quoting the following newline.
<P>
 Any occurrence of @name@ in the input is replaced in the output by
 the corresponding value.
<P>
 @name at beginning of line is treated the same as @name@.
<a name=4></a><H3> Applications</H3>
<a name=5></a><H4> Form Letters</H4>
<P>
We'll start with a toy example that illustrates some simple uses of m1. Here's a form letter that 
 I've often been tempted to use:
<PRE>
@default MYNAME Jon Bentley 
@default TASK respond to your special offer 
@default EXCUSE the dog ate my homework 
Dear @NAME@: 
    Although I would dearly love to @TASK@, 
I am afraid that I am unable to do so because @EXCUSE@. 
I am sure that you have been in this situation 
many times yourself. 
            Sincerely, 
            @MYNAME@ 
</PRE>
<P>
 If that file is namedsayno.mac, it might be invoked with this text: 
<PRE>
@define NAME Mr. Smith 
@define TASK subscribe to your magazine 
@define EXCUSE I suddenly forgot how to read 
</PRE>
<P>
Recall that a @default takes effect only if its variable was not previously @defined. 
<a name=6></a><H4> Troff Pre-Processing</H4>
<P>
I've found m1 to be a handy Troff preprocessor. Many of my text files (including this one) start 
 with m1 definitions like: 
<PRE>
@define ArrayFig @StructureSec@.2 
@define HashTabFig @StructureSec@.3 
@define TreeFig @StructureSec@.4 
@define ProblemSize 100 
</PRE>
<P>
Even a simple form of arithmetic would be useful in numeric sequences of definitions. The longer m1 
variables get around Troff's dreadful two-character limit on string names; these variables are also avail- 
able to Troff preprocessors like Pic and Eqn. Various forms of the @define, @if, and @include 
facilities are present in some of the Troff-family languages (Pic and Troff) but not others (Tbl); m1
provides a consistent mechanism. 
<P>
I include figures in documents with lines like this: 
<PRE>
@define FIGNUM @FIGMFMOVIE@ 
@define FIGTITLE The Multiple Fragment heuristic. 
@FIGSTART@ 
&lt;PS> &lt;@THISDIR@/mfmovie.pic&lt;/PS>
@FIGEND@ 
</PRE>
<P>
 The two @defines are a hack to supply the two parameters of number and title to the figure. The 
 figure might be set off by horizontal lines or enclosed in a box, the number and title might be printed at 
 the top or the bottom, and the figures might be graphs, pictures, or animations of algorithms. All 
 figures, though, are presented in the consistent format defined by FIGSTART and FIGEND. 
<a name=7></a><H4> Awk Library Management</H4>
<P>
 I have also used m1 as a preprocessor for Awk programs. The @include statement allows one 
 to build simple libraries of Awk functions (though some-  but not all- Awk implementations provide 
 this facility by allowing multiple program files). File inclusion was used in an earlier version of this 
 paper to include individual functions in the text and then wrap them all together into the completem1 
 program. The conditional statements allow one to customize a program with macros rather than run-time
 if statements, which can reduce both run time and compile time. 
<a name=8></a><H4> Controlling Experiments</H4>
<P>
 The most interesting application for which I've used this macro language is unfortunately too 
 complicated to describe in detail. The job for which I wrote the original version of m1 was to control a 
 set of experiments. The experiments were described in a language with a lexical structure that forced 
 me to make substitutions inside text strings; that was the original reason that substitutions are bracketed 
 by at-signs. The experiments are currently controlled by text files that contain descriptions in the experiment 
 language, data extraction programs written in Awk, and graphical displays of data written in Grap; 
 all the programs are tailored bym1commands.
<P>
 Most experiments are driven by short files that set a few keys parameters and then@includea 
 large file with many @defaults. Separate files describe the fields of shared databases: 
<PRE>
 @define N ($1) 
 @define NODES ($2) 
 @define CPU ($3) 
 ... 
</PRE>
<P>
 These files are @included in both the experiment files and in Troff files that display data from the 
 databases. I had tried to conduct a similar set of experiments before I built m1, and got mired in muck. 
 The few hours I spent building the tool were paid back handsomely in the first days I used it. 

<a name=9></a><H3> The Substitution Function</H3>
<P>
M1 uses as fast substitution function.
 The idea is to process the string from left to right, searching for the first substitution to be made. 
 We then make the substitution, and rescan the string starting at the fresh text. We implement this idea 
 by keeping two strings: the text processed so far is in L (for Left), and unprocessed text is in
 R (for 
 Right). Here is the pseudocode for dosubs:
<PRE>
L = Empty 
R = Input String 
while R contains an "@" sign do 
	let R = A @ B; set L = L A and R = B 
	if R contains no "@" then 
		L = L "@" 
		break 
	let R = A @ B; set M = A and R = B 
	if M is in SymTab then 
		R = SymTab[M] R 
	else 
		L = L "@" M 
		R = "@" R 
	return L R 
</PRE>
<a name=10></a><H3> Possible Extensions</H3>
<P>
 There are many ways in which them1program could be extended. Here are some of the biggest 
 temptations to "creeping creaturism": 
<UL>
<LI>
 A long definition with a trail of backslashes might be more graciously expressed by a 
 @longdefinestatement terminated by a@longend. 
<LI>
 An @undefinestatement would remove a definition from the symbol table. 
<LI>
 I've been tempted to add parameters to macros, but so far I have gotten around the problem by 
 using an idiom described in the next section. 
<LI>
 It would be easy to add stack-based arithmetic and strings to the language by adding@pushand 
 @popcommands that read and write variables. 
<LI>
 As soon as you try to write interesting macros, you need to have mechanisms for quoting strings 
 (to postpone evaluation) and for forcing immediate evaluation. 
</UL>

<a name=11></a><H2> Code</H2>
<P>
 The following code is short (around 100 lines),
 which is 
 significantly shorter than other macro processors; see, 
 for instance, Chapter 8 of Kernighan and Plauger [1981]. 
 The program uses several techniques that can be applied in many Awk programs. 
<UL>
<LI> Symbol tables are easy to implement with Awk¿s associative arrays.</LI>
<LI>
 The program makes extensive use of Awk's string-handling facilities: 
 regular expressions, string 
 concatenation, gsub, index, andsubstr. 
<LI>
 Awk's file handling makes the dofile procedure straightforward. 
<LI>
 The readline function and pushback mechanism associated with buffer are of general utility. 
</UL>

 M1 is three steps lower than m4.  You'll probably miss something
 you have learned to expect.
<a name=20></a><H2> History</H2>
<P>
M1 was documented in the 1997 sedawk book by Dale Dougherty & Arnold Robbins (ISBN 1-56592-225-5)
but may have been written earlier.
