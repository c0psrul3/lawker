<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Humdrum Toolkit provides a set of free software tools intended
to assist in music research. The toolkit is suitable for use in a
wide variety of computer-based musical tasks.

<p> The Humdrum web site contains a
comprehensive collection of over 200 web pages providing both
detailed and summary information concerning all aspects of the
Humdrum Toolkit.
<p>
 About 15% of the code is written in C,
 another 15% in kornshell, and about 2% using the
 LEX lexical parser and YACC compiler-compiler.
 The bulk of the code is written in AWK.
