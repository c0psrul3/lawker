<a name=1></a><H2> Background</H2>
My boss wants to put NOAA weather radar images in a looping presentation that is displayed as 720 video on the 1040 LCD TV in the atrium. He couldn't figure out how to download the various layers needed, so he gave me the task. Of course, I had a sample composite image for him in half an hour. It looked terrible on the TV: the writing came out as just a blur and the county and state lines (single pixel mostly) were essentially invisible. Obviously, I could make my own 'cities' overlay, but no tools I had would convert the 'counties' image to any usable vector format for line resizing.
<P>
That afternoon, I wrote a gawk script that widens the lines in a 256 color BMP version of the image - I can convert it back to a transparent background GIF later. 
<P>
That script was presented in <a href="http://awk.info/?bitmaps">awk.info July 30, 2009</a>.  
is an updated and extended version
<P>
 The script widens lines in .bmp files to make them more visible
 when converted to TV video images.  For the complete conversion, it
 is also necessary to mung the line colors to get rid of interpolated
 colors and togive some lines more contrast, but that is done elsewhere.
<P>
 This script is gawk specific.
<a name=2></a><H2> Code</H2>
<a name=3></a><H3> Bytes2Number</H3>
<P>
 This functions converts byte strings (binary numbers) into their 
 corresponding numeric strings so that they can be processed as gawk numbers.
 The lookup table (CharString) is a global variable.
 This code assumes that binary numbers are big-endian (most significant
 byte first) - it is up to the calling program to order the bytes.
<P>
<P>
 On the first use, the (global) LUT is created, then left for later use.  It
 consists of a list of characters from \000 to \777 in order - the (index
 value minus 1) of a character multiplied by the power of 256 corresponding
 to its position in the string is the byte's numerical weight.  The function
 doesn't care about the length of the byte string (within the integer limits
 of the gawk version and port).
<PRE>
function Bytes2Number( String,  x, y, z, Number ) {
	if( !CharString ) {
		for( x = 0; x &lt;= 255; x++ ) CharString = CharString sprintf( "%c", x )
	}
	x = split( String, Scratch, "" )
	Number = 0
	for( y = 1; y &lt;= x; y++ ) {
		z = index( CharString, Scratch[ y ] ) -1

		Number = Number + z * (256^(x - y))
	}
	return Number	# Note that Number is a regular gawk scalar variable.
}
</PRE>
<a name=4></a><H3> RealSize</H3>
<P>
 Uses a brute force approach to factor the image size into width and height
 numbers that actually match the real image size.  It searches around the
 nominal values for a pair of numbers that, when multiplied together, produce
 the known size of the image in pixels.
<PRE>
function RealSize( Wide, High, Pixels,  x, y ) {
	for( x = Wide - 5; x &lt;= Wide +5; x++ ) {
		for( y = High - 5; y &lt;= High + 5; y++ ) {
			if( x * y == Pixels ) {
				Width = x
				Height = y	
			}
		}
	}	
}
</PRE>
<a name=5></a><H3> BEGIN</H3>
<P>
 It is necessary to tell gawk to read/write the file as binary, especially under
 Windows where ^Z in files is a killer.  Setting BINMODE to 3 will also work,
 but it throws error messages.
<P>
 Setting FS to null causes gawk to make each byte a separate field.
<P>
 Testing indicates that, in Windows at least, it is necessary to specify RS, even though
 it would appear redundant to set it to \n - not doing so results in 0A0D being
 replaced with 0A in the output, with the loss of one byte for each occurance.
 The value is arbitrary - it has been tested using one of the line colors.
<PRE>
BEGIN{
	BINMODE = "rw"
	FS= ""
    # The next two lines are not strictly necessary- 
    # there are here for clarity.
	Header = ""
	ByteCount = 0
	RS = "\n"
}
</PRE>
<a name=6></a><H3> For Each Record...</H3>
<P>
 Read the file into an array.  If there are multiple lines, that is, if RS appears
 in the file, insert the record separator back into the array at the end of 
 each line for which RT exists.
<PRE>
{
	for( x = 1; x &lt;= NF; x++ ) Bytes[ ++ByteCount ] = $(x)	
	if( RT ) { Bytes[ ++ByteCount ] = RT }
}
</PRE>
<a name=7></a><H3> END</H3>
<P>
 Closing FILENAME here allows overwriting the original file - if that is
 desired, comment out the next line (which creates a new filename for the
 output).
<P>
 Regarding image parameters:  Width and Height are in pixels; Depth is the number of bytes
 per pixel; Data is the zero based index of the actual image in the file; Size 
 refers to the bytes in the file, not the image; ImgSize is the number of pixels
 in the image.
 Unfortunately, Width and Height may be wrong: RealSize() calculates the actual values
 as found from the data block.
<P>
 Once the image parameters are set, the two arrays for the image can be built: one to contain an unmodified
 copy (A) and one to contain a copy to be modified (B).  These arrays are
 indexed by line and dots (Height, Width); data are complete pixels.  The C 
 array is used to determine the background color: it uses the pixel data as indexes
 and the count of the number of copies of that pixel as values - the largest value
 represents the most common color, and assuming that the image is mostly background,
 therefore the background color.  This assumption will be true for almost all line art.
<P>
 When performing line widening: for each pixel that is not part of
 the background, copy its color to the four surrounding pixels, provided that
 they are background.  This approach prevents one line from encroaching on another,
 but does not prevent the ends of lines that do not intersect other lines from
 growing by one pixel on each pass through the program for each free end.
 u, v, w, and z (z has been reused) are the coordinates of the four pixels
 surrounding the one in work (defined by x and y).

<P>
 Note the final nested for loops in the above code.
 After the B array has been modified, the target file can be completed
 by reading that array out to the file pixel by pixel.  The array cannot be
 output during processing because pixels that have already been through
 the processor can still be changed.
