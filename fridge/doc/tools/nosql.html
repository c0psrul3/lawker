NoSQL is a fast, portable, relational database management system
without arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed)
that runs under, and interacts with, the UNIX Operating System.
It uses the "Operator-Stream Paradigm" described in <em>Unix Review</em>
(March, 1991, page 24, "A 4GL Language") where there  are a number
of "operators" that each perform a unique function on the data.
These operators are written in Awk and C, designed to be lightweight
Operators will have to be lightweight ones (have a small memory footprint and allows fast startup of the command).
<p>
The main reason why NoSQL decided to turn an original RDB system
into NoSQL is precisely that the former is entirely written in Perl.
Perl is a good programming language for writing self-contained
programs, but its pre-compilation phase and long start-up time are
worth paying only if once the program has loaded it can do everything
in one go. This contrasts sharply with the Operator-stream Paradigm,
where operators are chained together in pipelines of two, three or
more programs. The overhead associated with initializing Perl at
every stage of the pipeline makes pipelining Perl inefficient. A
better way of manipulating structured ASCII files is to use the AWK
programming language, which is much smaller than Perl, is more
specialized for this task, and is very fast at startup.
