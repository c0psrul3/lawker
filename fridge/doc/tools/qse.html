<h2>About QSE</h2>
<p>
QSE is a code library that implements various Unix utilities in an
embeddable
form and provides a set of APIs to embed them into an application. 
The
APIs
have been designed to be flexible enough to access various aspects of
an embedding  application and an embedded object from each other. 
<p>
By
 embedding
     a Unix utility into an application, a developer is relieved of
problems
caused by interacting with external programs and can have tighter
control
   over it. Currently the library contains the following utilities:
<ul>
<li> AWK Interpreter
<li>CUT Text Cutter
<li>SED Stream Editor
</ul>
<p>
QSEAWK is an embeddable AWK interpreter and is a part of the QSE
library.
The interpreter implements the language described in the book
    the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qse/">AWK Proramming Language</a>,
	 with some extensions. Its design focuses on building a flexible and robust
 embedding API with minimal platform dependency. An embedding
application
  is capable of:
<ul>
<li>adding new global variables and functions.
<li>getting and set the value of a global variable.
<li>calling a function with or without parameters and getting its return value.
<li> customizing I/O handlers for file, pipe, console I/O.
<li>creating multiple interpreters independent of each other.
<li>running a single script with different I/O streams independently.
<li> changing language features by setting options.
<li> and more
</ul>
<h2>But Why QSE?</h2>

<p> An advantage of embedding a scripting
language into an application is that you can extend an application by
changing scripts instead of recompiling the whole application. 
As
an AWK lover, I was a bit disappointed that I could not find any
embedded implementations of the AWK programming language that I could
squeeze into my applications. 

<p>QSE is designed to embedded Awk into other applications, rather
than being used as a standalone tool (though it is not impossible). 
Why did
I choose AWK as an embedded language? Simple. Both I and my clients
liked it and were too lazy to learn a new scripting language.

<p>
     Also, an embedded solution is a better solution that calling an
     external AWK interpreter:
<ul>
<Li>
There is the
extra overhead of forking an external process.
<lI>
There was an
absense of any AWK interpreters on the target platform
<li>
I found
version issues of an AWK interpreter.
<li>
I an  unable to extend the interpreter itself.  (e.g. adding an
						 application specific builtin function like hash_passwor).
</ul>
<p>
     Hence, my conclusion was to implement an embeddable awk interpreter myself.

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>
One of the applications I wrote implements password change policy in
an AWK script.
The application calls the
"is_password_acceptable" function with the password entered by a user,
before having accepted the user-entered password. It checks its return
value and determines to accept the password. 
<p>
Of course, the engine is
prearranged with global variables PASSWD_HISTORY_SIZE, and
PASSWORD_HISTORY_FILE, and a buitin function hash_password() using
flexiable QSEAWK API functions upon application start-up.
<p>
For example, here is  the sample AWK function below.
<pre>
function is_password_acceptable(passwd)
{
    # check the password length
    if (length(passwd) &lt; 8) return 0;
    # check if the password is composed of alphabets or digits only
    if (passwd ~ /^([[:alpha:]]+|[[:digit:]]+)$/) 
	return 0;
    if (PASSWD_HISTORY_SIZE > 0)
    {
	hashed = hash_passwd(passwd);
	# check if the password is found in the history file
	while ((getline entry &lt; PASSWD_HISTORY_FILE) > 0)
	{
	    if (hashed == entry)
	    {
		# an entry is found in the history.
		# reject the password
		close (PASSWD_HISTORY_FILE);
		return 0;
	    }
	}
	close (PASSWD_HISTORY_FILE);
    }
    return 1;
}
</pre>
<p>
The C application's password policy function is roughly shown below
also. Note that this application utilized the embedded QSEAWK
interprerter in an event(password change)-driven way, not entering the
BEGIN, pattern-action blocks, END loops.
<pre>
int is_password_acceptable (qse_awk_rtx_t* rtx, const char* passwd)
{
    qse_awk_val_t* ret, * arg[1];
    qse_bool_t ok;
    
    ... abbreviated ...
    
    /* transform a character string to an AWK value */
    arg[0] = qse_awk_rtx_makestrval0 (rtx, passwd);
    
    ... abbreviated ...
    
    /* increment the reference counter of arg[0] */
    qse_awk_rtx_refupval (rtx, arg[0]);
    /* call "is_password_acceptable" */
    ret = qse_awk_rtx_call (rtx, "is_password_acceptable", arg, 1);
    /* decrement the reference counter of arg[0] */
    qse_awk_rtx_refdownval (rtx, arg[0]);
    
    ... abbreviated ...
    
    /* get the boolean value from the return value */
    ok = qse_awk_rtx_valtobool (awk_rtx, ret);
    /* decrement the reference counter of the return value */
    qse_awk_rtx_refdownval (rtx, ret);
    /* accept or reject? */
    return ok? 0: -1;
}
</pre>
After all, I managed to get rid of any needs to recompile the whole
application and redeploy it whenever a client asks for password policy
change.
