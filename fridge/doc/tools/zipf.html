Much research has reported that human writings following well-defined laws.
For example, natural langauge text and software
programs conform tightly to simple and regular statistical
models. 
For example,
"Zipf's Laws"  states that multiplying a word's rank r by its 
frequency f produces (roughly) a constant value C : i.e. r times f is a constant. 
 The frequency f of a word is obtained by counting the number 
of times it occurs in a text, and r is obtained by ranking all 
the words by frequency (1. the ; 2. and, 3. I ; etc.) 

 Example of Zipf's Law for five words in the London-Lund 
corpus of spoken conversation: 
<pre>
r  X     f   = C 
35 very  836 = 29,260 
45 see   674 = 30,330 
55 which 563 = 30,965 
65 get   469 = 30,485 
75 out   422 = 31,650 
</pre>
Another way of expressing Zipf's Law is 
to say that 
frequency is reciprocally proportional to rank. 
For example, the 2nd-ranked word ("and") appears 
half 
as often 
as the 1st-ranked word ("the"). 
More generally, nth-ranked word appears 
1/n 
as often as "the" 
<p>
Here is a short awk program, saved as ~jfry/zipf.awk, that 
reads in a ranked frequency list and computes r times f. 
<pre>
BEGIN {printf "%20s%7s%7s%10s\n", "WORD","RANK","FREQ","C"} 
      {printf "%20s%7d%7d%10d\n", $2, NR, $1, NR*$1} 
</pre>
<p>This program can be run with
<pre>
awk -f ~jfry/zipf.awk 
</pre>
