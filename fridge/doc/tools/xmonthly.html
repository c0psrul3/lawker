xmonthly is a hybrid shell script (part bash/gawk/xtoolkit intrinsics) that displays an overview of reminders based on the current month.
<p> It is a simple example of how to use X-window tools with Gawk.
<p>
xmonthly employs gawk's implementation of the strftime() function in order to discern the current month. Non-english users must use the 1st three letters of each month in the xmonthly database as determined by the end user's local.
