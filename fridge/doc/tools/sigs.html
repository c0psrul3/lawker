Generates random signtures. Signatures and generation code included
in same file so installation is just a matter of calling one file.

document is always added to the signatures, followed one of
the folowing paragraphs, selected at radonom.
<P>
To add to the signtures, include them in the here document,
with one preceeding blank line.
