This paper describes a set of interfaces for numerical subroutines. Typing a short (often one-line) 
description allows one to solve problems in application domains including least-squares data 
fitting, differential equations, minimization, root finding, and integration. Our approach of 
"template-driven programming" makes it easy to build such an interface: a simple one takes a 
few hours to construct, while a few days suffice to build the most complex program we describe. 
<p>
It is straightforward to implement this approach on many systems. We 
have tailored our implementation to our computing environment: 
our numerical routines are from the Port library, we call the routines from
Fortran programs, and our interfaces are implemented in Awk. 
<p>
An appendix to the paper describes
"L2fit". This program 
performs only the least-squares regression to calculate the 
parameters; it does not prepare the graphical summary. It is implemented as 
a 50-line Awk program and a 40-line Fortran template. The complete L2fit is 
a 330-line Awk program that uses a 45-line Fortran template; it also uses a 
60-line Troff and Grap template to produce the output.
