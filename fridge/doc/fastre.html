<h1><join>Awk's RE Match Very Fast</join></h2>
<p><em>(This page is a summary of Russ Cox's excellent article <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple and Fast</a>.)</em>
<p>Russ Cox writes that Awk's regular expression library is surprisingly faster than that used in Perl, Ruby, and Python:
<ul>
This is a tale of two approaches to regular expression matching. One of them is in widespread use in the standard interpreters for many languages, including Perl. The other is used only in a few places, notably most implementations of <b>awk</b> and <b>grep</b>. The two approaches have wildly different performance characteristics.
<p>
Let's use superscripts to denote string repetition, so that a?<sup>3</sup>a<sup>3</sup> is shorthand for a?a?a?aaa. This lets us
define experiments where we
conduct timing experiments on using regular expressions to match the a?<sup>n</sup>a<sup>n</sup> against the string a<sup>n</sup>.
<p>
If we conduct those experiments, Perl requires over sixty seconds to match a 29-character string. The other approach, labeled Thompson NFA for reasons that will be explained later, requires <u>twenty microseconds</u> to match the string. <b>That's not a typo</b>. ...
the Thompson NFA implementation is a million times faster than Perl when running on a miniscule 29-character string. 
This  trends grows as we increase "n": the Thompson NFA handles a 100-character string in under 200 microseconds, while Perl would require over 1015 years. (Perl is only the most conspicuous example of a large number of popular programs that use the same algorithm; the above graph could have been Python, or PHP, or Ruby, or many other languages.).
</ul>
<p>For some details of his results, see the following graph. Note that the y-axis is logarithmic (increases by a power of ten for each tick) so
these differences are really big differences:

</center>
<p>The reason for these differences is very technical- but Cox's article offers an excellent and clear description of those details.
In short, the RE matcher used in Perl, Ruby, Python is a recursive algorithm that allows the match state to exist in only one
state at a time. 
A Thompson NFA used in Awk/Grep, on the other hand, allows a match to exist in multiple states. Using Thompson's NFA,
the  whole match process can be
pre-computed and cached at compile time, thus removing the backtrack-on-failure process.
<p>
And what is the lesson here? Next time someone tells you Awk is old-fashioned, cough politely and mention that at least in some
aspects, certain supposedly-more-modern languages do not offer all the support provided by dear-"old"- Awk.
