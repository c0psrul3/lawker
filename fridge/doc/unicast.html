<em>(Editor's Note: This page is a mirror of the original 
<a href="http://www.icir.org/tfrc/sims1.html">web site</a>.
It describes a collection of shell/awk/tcl scripts used
for modeling  complex domains. This code illustrates
how language choice is not a matter of "awk" vs "X". Rather,
systems can be a menagerie of different languages, including Awk.)</em>
<h2>Description</h2>
This page has pointers to the simulation scripts for the 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/share/pdf/tcp-friendly.pdf">Equation-Based Congestion Control for Unicast Applications</a>
by
Sally Floyd, Mark Handley, Jitendra Padhye, and Joerg Widmer,
May 2000,
SIGCOMM 2000.


<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
These simulation scripts are also available from in
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/tcl/">LAWKER</a>.
<p>To test the code:

<ul>
<li>
 Unpack this zip file:
<pre>
contents.zip
cd contents
</pre>
<p>To use these scripts, you must go the following:
<pre>
gcc bwcnt2.c -o bwcnt2
gcc bwcnt2a.c -o bwcnt2a
</pre>
<p> Then, put a copy of "ns" in the current directory, for example:
<pre>
ln -s ~/vint/ns-2/ns ns
</pre>
<p> To run the tests:
<pre>
./single.com
./tfrm12.com
./queue2.com
./increase.com
./reduce.com
./reduce1.com
</pre>
</ul>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
These scripts are quick amalgams of shell scripts, awk, tcl, and
whatever else was handy at the time, so they are not intended as an
example of good programming style.  They are run in a directory with a
"graphs" subdirectory for saved output and *.mf files (gnuplot command files),
and an "awk" subdirectory for awk files.  Some of these scripts use
supporting *.awk files that are available in the <a
href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/tcl/contents/awk">awk directory</a>, but are not listed separately
below.  Some of the scripts (tfrm12.run) also use "bwcnt" C programs
for processing output data; the C code for these is in the <a
href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/tcl/contents/">scripts directory</a>.  Possibly one day we will
clean this all up to reduce the proliferation of scripts and languages
involved.
<p>
The implementation of TFRC in the NS simulator 
is still occasionally being modified, so the precise results of
simulations can change with different versions of NS.

<p>
Some of these
simulations must be run with SBSIZE in scoreboard.h set to
10000 instead of to 1024, to allow larger TCP congestion windows.
<h2>From Scripts to Figures</h2>
<p>
The simulation for Figure 2 on
"Illustration of the Average Loss Interval"
can be run with
"contents/single.com",
with supporting files
"contents/single.run",
"contents/single.tcl",
and
"contents/queueSize.tcl".
Generating the postscript file also uses the following files:<br>
"contents/graphs/s0.interval.mf",
"contents/graphs/s0.loss.mf", and
"contents/graphs/s0.rate.mf". 
<p>
The simulations for Figure 5 on
"TCP flow sending rate"
can be run with 
"contents/tfrm-full.CA.DropTail.run", 
"contents/tfrm-full.CA.RED.run" 
with supporting files 
"contents/tfrm-full.CA.tcl",
"contents/queueSize.tcl",
"contents/getmean-full.tcl".
These scripts will produce data files called
<pre>
graphs/s-full-RED.CA.tcpmean
graphs/s-full-DropTail.CA.tcpmean
</pre>  
There are three values for
each data point (from three runs) in these output files.  To merge them, use 
"contents/merge2.tcl":
<PRE>
merge2.tcl graphs/graphs/s-full-RED.CA.tcpmean > graphs/s-full-RED.CA.tcp
merge2.tcl graphs/graphs/s-full-DropTail.CA.tcpmean > graphs/s-full-DropTail.CA.tcp
</PRE>
Unfortunately, we no longer have the *.mf gnuplot script for
generating the postscript from "s-full-RED.CA.tcp" and
"s-full-DropTail.CA.tcp".
<!--
Generating the postscript files using gnuplot also requires the following files:
graphs/<a href="contents/s-full-DropTail.CA.tcp.mf">s-full-DropTail.CA.tcp.mf</a>, 
graphs/<a href="contents/s-full-RED.CA.tcp.mf">s-full-RED.CA.tcp.mf</a>.
-->
BTW, on a 450MHz Xeon, each graph takes about 7 hours to generate
<p>
The simulations for Figure 6 on
can be run
with
"contents/tfrm12.com",
with supporting files
"contents/tfrm12.run",
"contents/tfrm12.tcl",
"contents/awk/plotdrops.awk"
and
"contents/queueSize.tcl".
The supporting programs
"bwcnt2" and "bwcnt2a" for processing the output data are compiled from
"contents/bwcnt2.c"
and "contents/bwcnt2a.c".
FYI:
On Sally's computer, this simulation set took 13 minutes.
The following supporting files were also required for generating
the postscript file
"contents/tfrm12.run1",
"contents/graphs/getmean.tcl",
"contents/graphs/s0.12.mf",
"contents/graphs/s0.loss3.mf".
<p>
The simulations for Figure 7 on "Coefficient
of variation of throughput between flows" can be run with 
"contents/tfrmvar.run" with supporting files 
"contents/tfrmvar.tcl", 
"contents/queueSize.tcl", and 
"contents/graphs/getvar.tcl".
The scripts
"contents/fixcov.tcl" combines the many output files together, and gnuplot requires "contents/graphs/s3xxx.mf" to generate the postscript.
<p>
When we have collected the scripts for Figure 8, we will put them on-line.
<p>
The simulations for Figures 9 and 10 can be run with the
script
"contents/long/doit".
The supporting scripts are in the tar file.
The simulation takes perhaps one hour.
<p>
The simulations for Figures 11-13 can be run with the
script
"contents/short/doit".
The simulation takes up to three days.
<p>
The simulations for
Figure 14 on
40 long-lived flows
can be run with
"contents/queue2.com", 
with supporting files
"contents/queue.run",
"contents/queue.tcl",
"contents/queueSize.tcl",
"contents/tracequeue.tcl",
awk/"contents/awk/plotaveq.awk",
and
awk/"contents/awk/plotqueue.awk".
Generating the postscript file also uses the following file:
"contents/graphs/s0.queue.mf".
<p>
Figures 15-18 are from experiments.
<p>
The simulations for Figure 19 on
"A TFRC flow with an end to congestion"
can be run with
"contents/increase.com", 
with supporting files
"contents/increase.run",
"contents/increase.tcl",
"contents/queueSize.tcl",
"contents/awk/increase.awk",
and graphs/"scriptsTR/graphs/s0.packetrate.mf".
<p>
The simulations for Figure 20 on
"A TFRC flow with persistent congestion"
can be run with
"contents/reduce.com",
with supporting files
"contents/reduce.run",
"contents/reduce.tcl",
"contents/queueSize.tcl",
"contents/awk/reduce.awk",
and
"contents/awk/reduce1.awk".
Generating the postscript file also uses the following file:
"contents/graphs/s0.rate1.mf".
<p>
The simulations for Figure 21 on
"Number of round-trip times to reduce the
sending rate" can be run with 
"contents/reduce1.com",
with supporting files
"contents/reduce1.run",
"contents/reduce.tcl",
"contents/queueSize.tcl",
"contents/awk/reduce1.awk",
and
"contents/awk/reduce2.awk".
Generating the postscript file also uses the following file:
graphs/"contents/graphs/s0.half.mf".
