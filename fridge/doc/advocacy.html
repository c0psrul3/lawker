<ul>
<li>More programming theory does not make better programmers.
<li>Don't let old/compiler people tell you what language to use.
<li> If there is already a way of doing something, do not invent a harder way.

<p>From <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/Tools/awk.shtml">Awk programming</a>:
<ul>
<li>Awk is a simple and elegant pattern scanning and processing language. 
<li>Awk is also the most portable scripting language in existence.  
<li>But why use it rather than Perl (or PHP or Ruby or...):
<ul>
<li>
     Awk is simpler (especially important if deciding which to learn first);
    <li>Awk syntax is far more regular (another advantage for the beginner, even without considering syntax-highlighting editors);
    <li> You may already know Awk well enough for the task at hand;
    <li> You may have only Awk installed;
    <li> Awk can be smaller, thus much quicker to execute for small programs.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>From <a href="?awksys">Awk as a Major Systems Programming Language</a>:
<ul>
<li> 
 Effective use of its data structures and its stream-oriented structure takes some
 adjustment for C programmers, but the results can be quite striking. 
</ul>
