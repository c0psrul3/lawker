<li>More programming theory does not make better programmers.
<li>Don't let old/compiler people tell you what language to use.
<li> If there is already a way of doing something, do not invent a harder way.

<p>From <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/Tools/awk.shtml">Awk programming</a>:
<ul>
<li>Awk is a simple and elegant pattern scanning and processing language. 
<li>Awk is also the most portable scripting language in existence.  
<li>But why use it rather than Perl (or PHP or Ruby or...):
<ul>
<li>
     Awk is simpler (especially important if deciding which to learn first);
    <li>Awk syntax is far more regular (another advantage for the beginner, even without considering syntax-highlighting editors);
    <li> You may already know Awk well enough for the task at hand;
    <li> You may have only Awk installed;
    <li> Awk can be smaller, thus much quicker to execute for small programs.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>From <a href="?awksys">Awk as a Major Systems Programming Language</a>:
<ul>
<li> 
 Effective use of its data structures and its stream-oriented structure takes some
 adjustment for C programmers, but the results can be quite striking. 
</ul> 

<p>According to <a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/01/yet-another-sudoku-puzzle-solver-using-awk/">Ramesh Natarajan</a>:
<ul>
	<li>
	AWK is a superb language for testing algorithms and applications with some complexity, especially where the problem can be broken into chunks which can streamed as part of a pipe. It's an ideal tool for augmenting the features of shell programming as it is ubiquitous; found in some form on almost all Unix/Linux/BSD systems. Many problems dealing with text, log lines or symbol tables are handily solved or at the very least prototyped with awk along with the other tools found on Unix/Linux systems.
</ul>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.strozzi.it/cgi-bin/CSA/tw7/I/en_US/NoSQL/Perl%20and%20NoSQL">NoSQL pages</a>:
<ul>
<li>
(Other languages like Perl is) a good programming language for
writing self-contained programs, but pre-compilation and
long start-up time are worth paying only if once the program has
loaded it can do everything in one go. This contrasts sharply with
the Operator-stream Paradigm, where operators are chained together
in pipelines of two, three or more programs. The overhead associated
with initializing (say) Perl at every stage of the pipeline makes pipelining
inefficient. A better way of manipulating structured ASCII
files is to use the AWK programming language, which is much smaller,
more specialized for this task, and is very fast at
startup.
</ul>
