<h1><join>Checkers Programming in Gawk</join></h1>
<p>
In early 2004, 
<a href="http://agave.garden.org/~aaronh/">Aaron Hawley</a>
 threw himself into a programming contest held by the University
 of Vermont Computer Science Student Association. The contest was
 a variation on checkers where competitors had their artifical
 computer players compete in a "virtual tournament". 
<p>It made for
 an interesting problem, and he chose to make it more interesting
 by writing his checker player in 
 Awk (in the implementation GNU Awk). He wasn't able to submit a
 working version then because of a technical problem, and the contest
 itself never was finalized due to a lack of submissions. 
<p>
Recently,
 he overcame the technical problems and finally put together a 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/bash/checkers/contents/vc5">working
 version</a> (not to be confused with winning). The heuristic used in
 this  checker player is not a winning strategy, but at least it plays.
 There is also the <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/bash/checkers/contents.zip">full build distribution</a>, 
that shows what 
 a large Awk project looks like, and some tricks on how
 to survive (hint: GNU Makefiles).
