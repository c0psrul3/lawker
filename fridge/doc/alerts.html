The current several classes of intrusion alert have various 
formats and semantics. And it is transferred using a variety of 
protocols. The protocols that transfer intrusion alert are IDXP, 
SNMP trap, SYSLOG protocol, etc. These varieties of intrusion 
alert formats make it difticult to use that together. Intrusion alert 
normalization makes various intrusion alert to same structure 
data and same semantics. We need this normalition process to 
unify alerts from a variety of security equipments. This paper 
describes how to normalize alerts from several IDS and security 
equipments.
