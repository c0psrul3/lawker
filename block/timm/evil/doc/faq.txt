=== Q1 =====================
Why is it called "evil"?

Cause we have this evil idea  that:

1) there is no evidence that supposedly better
programming languages increase productivity

2) we can write better programmers, faster, if we
jettison much of that research

3) the key factor in programmer productivity is
not the programming language. rather it
  is the programmer, the organizational context,
  etc etc.

Now this could be a really evil idea since, if true,
you've been buying bogus tools from the vendors. 

And, heh, we could be wrong- in the literature, evil
geniuses are usually defeated by super heroes
using the latest and greatest gadgets.  

But here,
the forces of evil will use their 1970s UNIX
scripting skills to make one last stand against
the forces of perpetual "evolution" of programming
language.

=== Q2 =====================
What you limit the application of these techniques 
if you call them something silly like evil"?

Hey- don't knock silly. Silly is fun. Silly is
motivating. Silly makes you try and try again and
try crazy things
that have never been attempted before.

Also, we call this work "evil" to attract the attention of the programmers who are questionning current practice and
seek an alternative. 
Thomas Kuhn once said  that scientists rarely change their views when new ideas come along, rather only when
the older generation dies out. It is highly unlikely that the current generation of software engineering industrial and
research instituions will apbondon their current profit models that require, every year, a bight new shiny
product. However, there is some hope that the next generation might heed our call and reduce the intracy of their development
tools.
